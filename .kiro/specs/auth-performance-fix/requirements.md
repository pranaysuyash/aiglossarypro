# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses critical authentication and performance issues currently affecting AIGlossaryPro. The application is experiencing an infinite authentication loop with repeated calls to `/api/auth/user`, causing high memory usage and system load. Additionally, Firebase network errors are preventing successful user login, and overall load times are impacting user experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Authentication Loop Resolution

**User Story:** As a user, I want to be able to log in successfully without the application getting stuck in an infinite loop, so that I can access the platform's features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user attempts to login THEN the `/api/auth/user` endpoint SHALL be called only once per authentication attempt
2. WHEN authentication state changes THEN React Query SHALL not trigger infinite re-renders
3. IF authentication fails THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message and stop retrying
4. WHEN a user is already authenticated THEN the system SHALL not continuously verify authentication status
5. WHEN authentication tokens expire THEN the system SHALL handle refresh gracefully without loops

### Requirement 2: Firebase Authentication Stability

**User Story:** As a user, I want reliable Firebase authentication that works consistently, so that I can access my account without network errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Firebase authentication is initialized THEN it SHALL handle network errors gracefully
2. WHEN login credentials are submitted THEN Firebase SHALL respond within 5 seconds or timeout with a clear error
3. IF Firebase is unavailable THEN the system SHALL provide fallback authentication or clear messaging
4. WHEN authentication state persists THEN it SHALL survive page refreshes without re-authentication
5. WHEN multiple authentication attempts occur THEN they SHALL be properly queued and not conflict

### Requirement 3: Memory Usage Optimization

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the application to use memory efficiently, so that server resources are not exhausted by authentication processes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application runs THEN memory usage SHALL not exceed 512MB under normal load
2. WHEN authentication loops are prevented THEN memory usage SHALL remain stable over time
3. IF memory usage spikes THEN the system SHALL log the cause and attempt garbage collection
4. WHEN React Query caches data THEN it SHALL have appropriate cache limits and expiration
5. WHEN authentication state is managed THEN it SHALL not create memory leaks

### Requirement 4: Load Time Performance

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to load quickly, so that I can start using it without waiting for slow page loads.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the homepage loads THEN it SHALL complete initial render in under 2 seconds
2. WHEN JavaScript bundles are loaded THEN they SHALL be optimized and code-split appropriately
3. IF large assets are required THEN they SHALL be lazy-loaded or compressed
4. WHEN the application initializes THEN only critical resources SHALL be loaded immediately
5. WHEN subsequent pages are accessed THEN they SHALL load in under 1 second

### Requirement 5: API Response Optimization

**User Story:** As a user, I want API calls to respond quickly and reliably, so that the application feels responsive and stable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API endpoints are called THEN they SHALL respond within 500ms for simple queries
2. WHEN database queries are executed THEN they SHALL be optimized with proper indexing
3. IF API calls fail THEN they SHALL implement exponential backoff retry logic
4. WHEN multiple API calls are needed THEN they SHALL be batched or parallelized where possible
5. WHEN API responses are cached THEN they SHALL have appropriate TTL values

### Requirement 6: Error Handling and Recovery

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear error messages and automatic recovery when authentication or loading issues occur, so that I understand what's happening and can take appropriate action.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authentication errors occur THEN users SHALL see specific, actionable error messages
2. WHEN network errors happen THEN the system SHALL automatically retry with exponential backoff
3. IF the application enters an error state THEN it SHALL provide a way to recover without page refresh
4. WHEN critical errors are detected THEN they SHALL be logged for debugging purposes
5. WHEN users encounter errors THEN they SHALL have clear next steps to resolve the issue

### Requirement 7: Authentication State Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want predictable and efficient authentication state management, so that the application behaves consistently across all components.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authentication state changes THEN it SHALL be propagated to all components efficiently
2. WHEN components mount THEN they SHALL not trigger unnecessary authentication checks
3. IF authentication state is uncertain THEN the system SHALL resolve it once and cache the result
4. WHEN users navigate between pages THEN authentication state SHALL persist without re-verification
5. WHEN the application starts THEN authentication state SHALL be determined within 1 second

### Requirement 8: Performance Monitoring

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want real-time monitoring of authentication and performance metrics, so that I can quickly identify and resolve issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authentication loops occur THEN they SHALL be detected and alerted immediately
2. WHEN load times exceed thresholds THEN performance alerts SHALL be triggered
3. IF memory usage spikes THEN monitoring SHALL capture stack traces and context
4. WHEN API response times degrade THEN the system SHALL log detailed timing information
5. WHEN users experience errors THEN they SHALL be tracked with user context for debugging
