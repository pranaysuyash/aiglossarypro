### Incident Management
- **Alerting:** Configure comprehensive alerts for performance degradation, errors, and security incidents.
- **Runbooks:** Develop clear runbooks and escalation procedures for common operational issues.
- **Rollback Strategy:** Design for quick and reliable rollback mechanisms in case of deployment failures.

## Dependencies & Risk Management

This section addresses the identification, assessment, and mitigation of project dependencies and potential risks.

### External Dependencies
- **Third-Party Services:** Document all external services (e.g., Firebase, AWS S3, Neon Database, as indicated by `package.json`) including their SLAs, potential points of failure, and fallback strategies.
- **API Integrations:** Design for resilient API integrations with proper error handling, retries, and circuit breakers.

### Technical Risks
- **Scalability Challenges:** Proactively identify and address potential scalability bottlenecks through load testing and architectural reviews.
- **Security Vulnerabilities:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities.
- **Technical Debt:** Implement a systematic approach to track, prioritize, and resolve technical debt.

### Project Risks
- **Resource Availability:** Plan for adequate team resources and expertise for development, testing, and operations.
- **Scope Creep:** Implement strict change management processes to control scope and prevent project delays.
- **Timeline Delays:** Build in buffer time for unforeseen challenges and regularly review project progress against timelines.
