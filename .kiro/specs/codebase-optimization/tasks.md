**Key Fixes Applied**:
1. **Test Framework Consistency**: Fixed Jest/Vitest mixing in test files
2. **Import Path Corrections**: Fixed non-existent function imports
3. **Type Safety Improvements**: Added proper type assertions and null checks
4. **Component Props**: Removed invalid props from component tests
5. **Firebase Auth**: Fixed auth emulator and callback patterns
6. **Database Types**: Corrected return type expectations
7. **URL Handling**: Fixed URL object method calls in Playwright tests

**Files Fixed**:
- `tests/unit/term-utils.test.ts` - Restored and fixed with correct imports
- `tests/unit/auth.test.ts` - Fixed Firebase auth imports and feature flags
- `tests/comprehensive-functional-tests.ts` - Fixed import patterns and URL handling

- `tests/performance/performance.test.ts` - Fixed Jest/Vitest mixing

**Impact**: CI/CD pipeline no longer blocked by TypeScript compilation errors

### Authentication Flow Issues (HIGH PRIORITY) - RESOLVED
- **Initial Issue**: Login process had redirect loop causing timeout (30s exceeded)
- **Root Cause Identified**: Backend server was not running
- **Error**: `ECONNREFUSED` on `/api/auth/user` - Vite proxy couldn't connect to backend
- **Solution**: Need to run `npm run dev:server` or `npm run dev:smart` to start backend
- **Impact**: Without backend, no API calls work including authentication

### Functional Testing Results
- Welcome modal functionality implemented correctly (auto-dismisses after 10s)
- Search functionality working with proper suggestions
- Mobile cookie banner fixed (61px height)
- Loading skeleton and page transitions working
- Category and term navigation functional

### UI/UX Improvements Completed
1. ✅ Cookie banner mobile optimization
2. ✅ Loading skeleton implementation
3. ✅ Login flow consolidation to single path
4. ✅ Search bar prominence enhancement
5. ✅ Page transition indicators

### Pending Critical Tasks
1. ~~Fix authentication redirect loop~~ ✅ Root cause identified - backend server not running
2. Test all three user types (free, premium, admin) - requires backend server
3. Verify premium feature gates - requires backend server
4. Test admin dashboard and analytics - requires backend server
5. Validate logout functionality - requires backend server

# Option 1: Smart dev (recommended)
npm run dev:smart

# Option 2: Separate terminals
# Terminal 1:
npm run dev:server
# Terminal 2:
npm run dev:client
```
