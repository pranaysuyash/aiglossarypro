# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses critical TypeScript compilation errors that are blocking AWS App Runner deployment with Node 20 and ESM modules. The TypeScript bundler was previously hiding these errors, but the strict compilation required for production deployment has revealed type conflicts and missing declarations that must be resolved.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Duplicate Type Declaration Resolution

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to resolve duplicate Request/Response type declarations, so that the TypeScript compiler can successfully build the application for production deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN TypeScript compilation runs THEN there SHALL be no duplicate Request/Response type declarations
2. WHEN Express types are imported THEN they SHALL use proper namespaced imports to avoid conflicts
3. IF global Request/Response types exist THEN they SHALL be removed in favor of Express-specific types
4. WHEN server files import Request/Response THEN they SHALL use `import type { Request as ExpressRequest, Response as ExpressResponse } from 'express'`
5. WHEN validation utilities are used THEN they SHALL reference the correct Express types

### Requirement 2: Database Query Type Safety

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper database query typing, so that all database operations are type-safe and the application compiles without errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN database queries are executed THEN the `db()` function SHALL be properly imported and typed
2. WHEN `getDb()` is called THEN it SHALL return a properly typed database connection
3. IF `@ts-nocheck` comments exist in database files THEN they SHALL be removed after fixing type issues
4. WHEN Drizzle ORM is used THEN all queries SHALL have proper type inference
5. WHEN database connections are established THEN they SHALL use the correct connection pattern

### Requirement 3: Missing Type Declaration Coverage

**User Story:** As a developer, I want complete type declarations for all dependencies, so that the TypeScript compiler can resolve all module imports.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN third-party modules are imported THEN they SHALL have proper type declarations
2. WHEN custom type declarations are needed THEN they SHALL be added to `server/types/missing.d.ts`
3. IF Vite types are needed for development THEN they SHALL be properly declared
4. WHEN module resolution fails THEN appropriate type declarations SHALL be added
5. WHEN the build process runs THEN all module imports SHALL resolve successfully

### Requirement 4: Error Manager Type Consistency

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent error handling types, so that error management works reliably across the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors are handled THEN the `originalError` property SHALL accept both Error and undefined types
2. WHEN error types are defined THEN they SHALL be consistent across all error handling code
3. IF type assignments fail THEN the error type definitions SHALL be updated to accommodate the usage patterns
4. WHEN error context is provided THEN it SHALL have proper type safety
5. WHEN error recovery occurs THEN all error properties SHALL be properly typed

### Requirement 5: Express Middleware Type Safety

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper Express middleware typing, so that all request/response operations are type-safe and compilation succeeds.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Express middleware is defined THEN it SHALL use proper Request and Response types
2. WHEN request properties are accessed THEN they SHALL be properly typed (params, query, body)
3. WHEN response methods are called THEN they SHALL have correct type signatures (status, json, send)
4. IF validation middleware is used THEN it SHALL have proper type integration with Express
5. WHEN authentication middleware runs THEN it SHALL properly type user context

### Requirement 6: Production Build Compatibility

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want the application to compile successfully for production deployment, so that AWS App Runner can build and deploy the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN `npm run build:server` is executed THEN it SHALL complete without TypeScript errors
2. WHEN ESM modules are used THEN they SHALL be properly typed and imported
3. IF Node 20 compatibility is required THEN all types SHALL be compatible with Node 20
4. WHEN the production build runs THEN no `@ts-nocheck` comments SHALL remain in the codebase
5. WHEN deployment occurs THEN the TypeScript compilation SHALL not block the deployment process

### Requirement 7: Type Safety Maintenance

**User Story:** As a developer, I want maintainable type safety, so that future changes don't introduce type errors and the codebase remains robust.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new code is added THEN it SHALL follow the established typing patterns
2. WHEN types are modified THEN they SHALL maintain backward compatibility where possible
3. IF breaking type changes are needed THEN they SHALL be documented and communicated
4. WHEN code reviews occur THEN type safety SHALL be verified
5. WHEN the CI/CD pipeline runs THEN TypeScript compilation SHALL be enforced as a quality gate
