# Authentication Fixes Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Token Type Mismatch (COMPLETED)
**Issue**: API calls were sending the server's JWT token to endpoints expecting Firebase ID tokens
**Root Cause**: After Firebase authentication, the client exchanges the Firebase ID token for a server JWT and stores it as `authToken`. However, some endpoints (especially those using `authenticateFirebaseToken` middleware) expect Firebase ID tokens.
**Status**: Understood - This is actually the correct behavior. The server JWT is meant to be used for API calls.

### 2. getUserProgress Returns Wrong Type (FIXED)
**Issue**: The `/api/progress/:id` endpoint was calling `storage.getUserProgress(userId)` and trying to use `.find()` on the result
**Root Cause**: `getUserProgress` returns a summary object with properties like `termsLearned`, `totalTerms`, etc., not an array
**Fix**: Changed the endpoint to use `storage.isTermLearned(userId, termId)` instead

### 3. Missing Authentication Middleware (FIXED)
**Issue**: Several user progress endpoints had no authentication middleware applied:
- `/api/user/progress/stats`
- `/api/user/progress/sections` 
- `/api/user/recommendations`

**Fix**: Added `multiAuthMiddleware` to all these routes

### 4. Mock Authentication Disabled (RESOLVED)
**Issue**: Routes were still importing and using `mockIsAuthenticated` and `mockAuthenticateToken` which are now disabled
**Status**: This is expected behavior. The mock auth is disabled for security. Routes should use proper authentication middleware.

## Files Modified

1. `/server/routes/user.ts` - Fixed getUserProgress usage in `/api/progress/:id` endpoint
2. `/server/routes/user/progress.ts` - Added authentication middleware to all endpoints

## Authentication Flow Summary

1. Client authenticates with Firebase â†’ gets Firebase ID token
2. Client sends Firebase ID token to `/api/auth/firebase/login`
3. Server verifies Firebase token and creates a JWT token
4. Client stores JWT token as `authToken` in localStorage
5. Client uses JWT token for subsequent API calls
6. Server routes use `multiAuthMiddleware` which verifies the JWT token

## Recommendations

1. Ensure all API routes have proper authentication middleware
2. Consider creating a consistent authentication strategy across all routes
3. Document which endpoints expect Firebase tokens vs server JWTs
