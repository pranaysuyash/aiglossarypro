# Authentication Fixes - Round 2

## Summary of Issues Fixed

### 1. Route Ordering Issue (FIXED)
**Problem**: `/api/progress/:id` was catching requests for `/api/progress/stats` because routes were registered in the wrong order
**Fix**: Reordered route registration in `server/routes/index.ts` to register `registerProgressRoutes` BEFORE `registerUserRoutes`

### 2. Mock Authentication Still Being Used (FIXED)
**Problem**: Several routes were still using `mockIsAuthenticated` and `mockAuthenticateToken` which are disabled
**Fixed in these files**:
- `/server/routes/terms.ts` - Changed to use `multiAuthMiddleware`
- `/server/routes/analytics.ts` - Changed to use `multiAuthMiddleware` and `authenticateToken`
- `/server/routes/personalization.ts` - Changed to use `multiAuthMiddleware`
- `/server/routes/jobs.ts` - Changed to use `multiAuthMiddleware`

### 3. Firebase Token vs Server JWT Issue
**Understanding**: The system is working correctly:
1. Client authenticates with Firebase and gets Firebase ID token
2. Client exchanges Firebase token for server JWT at `/api/auth/firebase/login`
3. Server JWT is stored as `authToken` and used for subsequent API calls
4. Most endpoints use `multiAuthMiddleware` which validates the server JWT
5. Only Firebase-specific endpoints (those using `authenticateFirebaseToken`) expect Firebase tokens

## Root Cause Analysis

The errors were caused by:
1. **Route ordering** - Express matches routes in the order they're registered, so `/api/progress/:id` was matching before `/api/progress/stats`
2. **Incomplete migration** - Some routes were still using the disabled mock authentication instead of the proper authentication middleware
3. **Token confusion** - The "no kid claim" error happens when optionalFirebaseAuth tries to verify a server JWT as if it were a Firebase token

## Testing Recommendations

1. Clear browser storage and test fresh login
2. Verify `/api/progress/stats` now returns progress statistics instead of UUID error
3. Confirm no more "Mock authentication is DISABLED" errors in server logs
4. Check that authenticated API calls work correctly with the server JWT token
