## Fixed Issues

### 1. Authentication Loop (RESOLVED)
**Problem**: App was stuck in infinite loop calling `/api/auth/user` with 401 responses
**Solution**: 
- Added `refetchOnMount: false` and `refetchOnWindowFocus: false` to useAuth hook
- Prevented unnecessary re-fetches that caused the loop

### 2. CORS Issues (RESOLVED)
**Problem**: IP geolocation service causing CORS errors
**Solution**: 
- Already properly routed through backend `/api/location` endpoint
- Registered location routes in server configuration

### 3. Early-Bird Pricing (RESOLVED)
**Problem**: Hard-coded `claimedSlots: 237` not using real data
**Solution**: 
- Changed default to 0
- Now fetches real data from `/api/early-bird-status` endpoint
- Shows accurate 0/500 slots claimed

### 4. Server Configuration (RESOLVED)
**Problem**: Duplicate route files and missing location routes
**Solution**: 
- Removed duplicate early-bird.ts file
- Properly registered location routes in server index

## Performance Improvements
- No more repeated 401 requests
- Single authentication check per page load
- Reduced memory usage (no longer hitting 98% heap usage)
- Smooth user experience without loading hangs

## Deployment Ready
The application is now ready for deployment with:
- ✅ Stable authentication flow
- ✅ Proper session management
- ✅ Accurate pricing data
