# Comprehensive Audit Suite: Product Requirements Document (PRD) for AIGlossaryPro

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1. Problem Statement

As the AIGlossaryPro application evolves, ensuring consistent quality across its visual presentation, user experience, accessibility, and performance becomes increasingly challenging. Manual testing is time-consuming, prone to human error, and does not scale with rapid development cycles. Uncaught regressions can lead to a degraded user experience, accessibility barriers, performance bottlenecks, and a decline in overall product quality.

### 1.2. Solution Overview

This document outlines the requirements for a comprehensive, automated audit suite designed to proactively identify and report issues across five critical quality pillars: Visual & Interaction Correctness, Accessibility, Performance, Functional Correctness, and Code Quality. By integrating industry-standard tools and establishing clear testing methodologies, this suite will serve as a reliable "second eye" for the development team, enabling faster iteration, higher quality releases, and a superior user experience.

## 2. Goals & Objectives

The primary goal is to establish a robust, automated quality assurance framework that provides continuous feedback on the application's health.

### 2.1. SMART Goals

*   **Visual & Interaction Correctness:** Achieve 95% visual consistency across all major components and pages on supported browsers and devices (desktop, tablet, mobile) by Q4 2025, as measured by automated visual regression tests.
*   **Accessibility:** Identify and report 100% of WCAG 2.1 Level AA violations on key user flows by Q4 2025, as measured by automated `axe-core` scans.
*   **Performance:** Maintain Lighthouse performance scores above 90 for key landing and content pages by Q4 2025, and identify all critical React performance anti-patterns, as measured by Lighthouse and React Scan reports.
*   **Functional Correctness:** Ensure 98% pass rate for critical user flows (e.g., authentication, search, content interaction) by Q4 2025, as measured by automated functional tests.
*   **Code Quality:** Enforce 100% adherence to predefined ESLint and Biome rules for all new and modified code by Q4 2025, as measured by automated linting checks.
*   **Efficiency:** Reduce manual visual, accessibility, and functional testing effort by 70% by Q1 2026.

## 6. Technical Design & Architecture

### 6.1. Tooling Stack

*   **Browser Automation:** Playwright (unified framework for all browser interactions).
*   **Component Isolation:** Storybook.
*   **Visual Regression:** Playwright's `toHaveScreenshot` API.
*   **Accessibility:** `axe-core` (via `@axe-core/playwright`).
*   **Performance Analysis:** Lighthouse (via Playwright), React Scan.
*   **Functional Testing:** Playwright (leveraging existing `comprehensive-functional-audit.ts` script).
*   **Code Quality:** ESLint, Biome.
*   **Test Runner:** Playwright Test Runner (for `.spec.ts` files), `tsx` for custom scripts.

### 6.2. Integration & Data Flow

*   **Playwright Configuration:** A single, root-level `playwright.config.js` will define global settings, projects (for different browsers/devices), and `testDir`.
*   **Test File Organization:** Test files will reside in `tests/visual/` and `tests/functional/` (new directory) and follow the `*.spec.ts` naming convention.
*   **Storybook Integration:** Playwright will connect to a running Storybook instance (typically `http://localhost:6006`) to access component stories via their iframe URLs.
*   **Report Aggregation:** A dedicated script will collect JSON outputs from Playwright (visual diffs), `axe-core` (accessibility violations), Lighthouse (performance metrics), React Scan (static analysis), ESLint, Biome, and functional test results.
*   **Unified Report Generation:** The aggregated data will be transformed into a single, interactive HTML report.

## 7. Reporting Specifications

## 8. Usage & Workflow

### 8.1. Running the Audit Suite

*   **Local Development:** Developers can run the full suite or individual audit pillars via `npm` scripts (e.g., `npm run test:audit:all`, `npm run test:visual:storybook`, `npm run test:functional:all`).
*   **CI/CD Pipeline:** The suite will be integrated into the CI/CD pipeline to run automatically on pull requests or merges to main branches.

### 8.2. Interpreting Results

*   The unified HTML report will be the primary source for understanding audit results.
*   Visual diffs will clearly show UI changes.
*   Accessibility reports will provide actionable steps for remediation.
*   Performance metrics will highlight areas for optimization.
*   Functional test results will pinpoint broken user flows.

### 8.3. Updating Visual Baselines

*   When intentional UI changes are made, developers SHALL update the visual baselines by running `npx playwright test --update-snapshots`. This process will be clearly documented.

## 9. Future Considerations

*   **Cross-Browser/Device Matrix:** Expand testing to a wider range of browsers and real devices.
*   **Automated Performance Budgeting:** Integrate performance budgets into the CI pipeline to fail builds if metrics exceed predefined thresholds.
*   **Advanced Accessibility Scenarios:** Implement more complex accessibility tests, including screen reader testing and keyboard-only navigation flows.
*   **Integration with Project Management Tools:** Automatically create tickets in Jira/GitHub Issues for critical audit findings.
*   **Historical Trend Analysis:** Store audit results over time to track quality trends and identify regressions early.

## 10. Current Status

We are currently in **Phase 2, Step 1: Create the Component-Level Visual Audit (`test:visual:storybook`)**.

*   **Status:** The `visual-audit-storybook.spec.ts` script has been created and the `playwright.config.js` has been configured. We are actively debugging an issue where Playwright is not discovering the test files, manifesting as "Playwright Test did not expect test.describe() to be called here" errors. This is likely due to an incorrect `testMatch` pattern or a subtle interaction with the project's TypeScript setup.

*   **Immediate Next Step:** Resolve the Playwright test discovery issue to enable the execution of the `test:visual:storybook` audit. This involves ensuring `playwright.config.js` correctly points to the test files and that Playwright's test runner can properly parse and execute them within the project's environment.
