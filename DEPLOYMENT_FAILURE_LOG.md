# Deployment Failure Log - AWS App Runner

**Date**: August 1, 2025  
**Objective**: Deploy the restored `npm run dev:smart` functionality to AWS App Runner  
**Current Status**: 🔄 IN PROGRESS (Attempt #6)

---

## Timeline of Deployment Attempts

### Attempt #1: Docker/ECR with GitHub Secrets Approach
**Time**: 08:54 - 09:10  
**Service**: `aiglossarypro-app-dev-restored`  
**Approach**: Used GitHub workflow with Docker build + ECR push + GitHub secrets for env vars  
**Result**: ❌ FAILED  

**Error**: Missing environment variables
```
[ERROR] Environment validation failed: 
[ERROR]   - Missing required environment variable: DATABASE_URL 
[ERROR]   - Missing required environment variable: SESSION_SECRET
```

**Root Cause**: Environment variables from GitHub secrets weren't being passed to App Runner service properly  
**Fix Applied**: Added comprehensive environment variables to GitHub workflow using `environment-variables:` parameter  

---

### Attempt #2: Docker/ECR with GitHub Secrets (Fixed)
**Time**: 09:11 - 09:25  
**Service**: `aiglossarypro-app-dev-restored` (new instance)  
**Approach**: Same as #1 but with environment variables properly configured in workflow  
**Result**: ❌ FAILED  

**Error**: GitHub push protection blocked commit
```
remote: - Push cannot contain secrets
remote: OpenAI API Key detected in .github/workflows/deploy-aws-dev-restored.yml:87
```

**Root Cause**: Hardcoded secrets in workflow file triggered GitHub's secret scanning  
**Fix Applied**: Switched to using GitHub secrets references instead of hardcoded values  

---

### Attempt #3: Docker/ECR with Proper GitHub Secrets
**Time**: 09:25 - 09:45  
**Service**: `aiglossarypro-app-dev-restored` (updated)  
**Approach**: Used GitHub secrets properly with `${{ secrets.SECRET_NAME }}` syntax  
**Result**: ❌ FAILED (Service Creation Failed)  

**Error**: App Runner service creation failed  
**Root Cause**: Realized working deployment uses GitHub repository source, not Docker/ECR  
**Fix Applied**: Abandoned Docker approach, switched to GitHub repository-based deployment like working service  

---

### Attempt #4: GitHub Repository Source (Wrong Branch)
**Time**: 09:46 - 09:58  
**Service**: `aiglossarypro-app-dev-restored-v2`  
**Approach**: GitHub repository source using main branch and root directory  
**Result**: ❌ FAILED  

**Error**: `pnpm: command not found`
```
[Build] /bin/sh: line 1: pnpm: command not found
[Build] The command '/bin/sh -c cd ../.. && pnpm install --no-frozen-lockfile' returned a non-zero code: 127
```

**Root Cause**: Root `apprunner.yaml` had incorrect pnpm setup - PATH export didn't persist across build stages  
**Fix Applied**: Moved PATH export to build stage instead of pre-build  

---

### Attempt #5: GitHub Repository Source (Fixed pnpm PATH)
**Time**: 09:58 - 10:05  
**Service**: `aiglossarypro-app-dev-restored-v3`  
**Approach**: GitHub repository source with corrected apprunner.yaml  
**Result**: ❌ FAILED  

**Error**: Same `pnpm: command not found` error  
**Root Cause**: User pointed out I was deploying wrong approach - should use working service's configuration  
**Fix Applied**: Copied exact configuration from working service (`apps/api` directory, `corepack enable`)  

---

### Attempt #6: GitHub Repository Source (Correct Configuration)
**Time**: 10:07 - 10:31  
**Service**: `aiglossarypro-app-main-fixed`  
**Approach**: GitHub repository source using main branch with `corepack enable` for pnpm  
**Result**: ❌ FAILED  

**Status**: Build progressed further but failed on frontend
- ✅ Pre-build: pnpm installed with corepack  
- ✅ Dependencies: 2270 packages installed  
- ✅ Backend build: Completed successfully  
- ❌ Frontend build: FAILED  

**Error**: Frontend build failing on shared types import
```
[vite-plugin-pwa:build] Could not resolve "../../../shared/types" from "src/interfaces/interfaces.ts"
```

**Root Cause**: Relative imports to shared packages not working in production build  
**Fix Applied**: 
1. Fixed `apps/web/src/interfaces/interfaces.ts` - replaced `../../../shared/types` with `@aiglossarypro/shared/types`
2. Discovered 8 more files with same issue - fixed all using batch replace
3. Committed all fixes in commit `284a9304`

**Final Status**: Service went to CREATE_FAILED state, had to delete and recreate

---

### Attempt #7: GitHub Repository Source (All Import Fixes Applied)
**Time**: 10:31 - 10:54  
**Service**: `aiglossarypro-app-final`  
**Service URL**: https://aszmfa8ypc.us-east-1.awsapprunner.com  
**Approach**: GitHub repository source with ALL shared types imports fixed  
**Result**: ❌ FAILED (New Error - Start Command)

**Progress Made**:
- ✅ Successfully pulled source code from GitHub
- ✅ Successfully validated apprunner.yaml configuration  
- ✅ **BUILD SUCCEEDED** - All packages built successfully!
- ✅ Frontend build completed without shared types errors
- ✅ Provisioned instances successfully
- ❌ Failed at container startup

**Error**: Invalid start command format
```
exec: "NODE_ENV=production": executable file not found in $PATH
CannotStartContainerError: failed to create shim task: OCI runtime create failed: 
unable to start container process: error during container init
```

**Root Cause**: App Runner doesn't support environment variable assignments in command like `NODE_ENV=production node dist/index.js`
**Fix Applied**: 
- Changed command from `NODE_ENV=production node dist/index.js` to `node dist/index.js`
- NODE_ENV already set in env section of apprunner.yaml
- Committed fix in `2e3d72dc`

**Status**: Auto-deployment triggered with start command fix

---

### Attempt #8: GitHub Repository Source (Start Command Fixed)
**Time**: 10:54 - 11:15  
**Service**: `aiglossarypro-app-final` (auto-redeployment)  
**Service URL**: https://aszmfa8ypc.us-east-1.awsapprunner.com  
**Approach**: Same service, auto-deployment with start command fix  
**Result**: ❌ FAILED (Auto-deployment didn't trigger)

**Issue**: Service remained in CREATE_FAILED state, auto-deployment didn't trigger
**Root Cause**: Service was stuck and needed to be deleted/recreated
**Action**: Deleted failed service and created new one

---

### Attempt #9: GitHub Repository Source (Complete Fix - New Service)
**Time**: 11:15 - 11:38  
**Service**: `aiglossarypro-app-success`  
**Service URL**: https://hrfuzdmjp2.us-east-1.awsapprunner.com  
**Approach**: Fresh service with ALL accumulated fixes  
**Result**: ❌ FAILED (Path Error)

**Progress Made**:
- ✅ Successfully pulled source code from GitHub
- ✅ Successfully validated apprunner.yaml configuration  
- ✅ **BUILD SUCCEEDED** - Application source code built successfully
- ✅ Successfully provisioned instances and deployed image
- ❌ Failed during health check - application couldn't start

**Error**: Module not found
```
Error: Cannot find module '/app/dist/index.js'
```

**Root Cause**: Wrong path - API server builds to `apps/api/dist/index.js` not `dist/index.js`
**Fix Applied**: 
- Changed run command from `node dist/index.js` to `node apps/api/dist/index.js`
- Committed fix in `09d4e6ee`

**Status**: Auto-deployment triggered with correct path

---

### Attempt #10: GitHub Repository Source (Correct Module Path)
**Time**: 11:38 - 11:50  
**Service**: `aiglossarypro-app-success` (auto-redeployment)  
**Service URL**: https://hrfuzdmjp2.us-east-1.awsapprunner.com  
**Approach**: Same service, auto-deployment with correct module path  
**Result**: ❌ FAILED

**All Fixes Applied**:
- ✅ All shared types imports using workspace aliases (9 files fixed)
- ✅ pnpm installation with `corepack enable`  
- ✅ Build process working (builds all packages)
- ✅ Start command corrected: `node apps/api/dist/index.js` (correct path)
- ✅ Environment variables properly configured

**Error**: Deployment failed - DNS never resolved, service URL remained inaccessible
**Root Cause**: Unknown - need to check AWS console for deployment logs
**Status**: Service deployment failed after module path fix

## Key Lessons Learned

### 1. **Wrong Deployment Method**
- **Mistake**: Started with Docker/ECR approach instead of checking working service configuration
- **Learning**: Always examine working deployments first to understand the correct approach

### 2. **Incomplete Migration Fixes**  
- **Mistake**: Claimed to have fixed all monorepo issues but left relative imports unfixed
- **Learning**: Must systematically search and fix ALL import issues, not discover them during deployment

### 3. **Environment Variable Strategy**
- **Mistake**: Overcomplicated with GitHub secrets when App Runner's built-in env vars would work
- **Learning**: Follow the exact pattern of working deployments

### 4. **Branch and Directory Confusion**
- **Mistake**: Used wrong branch (main vs monorepo-migration) and directory (root vs apps/api)  
- **Learning**: Match working service configuration exactly

### 5. **CRITICAL: Not Understanding Build Output Paths** ⚠️
- **Mistake**: Assumed build outputs to root `dist/` when it actually outputs to `apps/api/dist/`
- **Should Have Done**:
  1. Checked the build logs which clearly showed: `> @aiglossarypro/api@1.0.0 build /app/apps/api`
  2. Examined the working service's run command or file structure
  3. Understood monorepo structure where each app builds in its own directory
- **Learning**: ALWAYS verify build output paths before configuring run commands
- **Time Wasted**: ~25 minutes and 1 failed deployment that could have been avoided

## Root Cause Analysis (August 1, 2025 5:50 PM)

### 🔍 Investigation Findings

**Primary Issue**: Configuration mismatch between main branch and working monorepo deployment

**Key Differences Identified**:
1. **Working deployment (monorepo-migration branch)**:
   - Uses `apps/api` as source directory in AWS App Runner
   - Complex build process with package.deploy.json swapping
   - Run command: `node dist/index.js` (relative to apps/api)
   - Proven to work successfully

2. **Failing deployment (main branch)**:
   - Uses `.` (root) as source directory
   - Simpler build process that doesn't handle monorepo structure properly
   - Missing individual workspace package builds
   - Run command: `node apps/api/dist/index.js` (from root)

### ✅ Fix Applied

Updated root `apprunner.yaml` to properly handle monorepo structure:
- Added individual workspace package builds
- Changed to `apps/api` directory before building API
- Added build output verification
- Included all required environment variables

**Current apprunner.yaml now includes**:
```yaml
# Build workspace packages first
- pnpm --filter @aiglossarypro/shared run build
- pnpm --filter @aiglossarypro/database run build
- pnpm --filter @aiglossarypro/auth run build
- pnpm --filter @aiglossarypro/config run build

# Build API with proper context
- cd apps/api && SKIP_TYPE_CHECK=true NODE_ENV=production pnpm run build
```

## Next Deployment Attempt (#11)

**Approach**: Two options available
1. **Option 1 (Recommended)**: Change AWS App Runner source directory to `apps/api`
   - This uses the proven working configuration
   - Most likely to succeed immediately

2. **Option 2**: Deploy with updated root apprunner.yaml
   - Uses the fixed configuration that now properly handles monorepo
   - May still have unknown issues

**Status**: ⏳ Ready to deploy with fixes applied
