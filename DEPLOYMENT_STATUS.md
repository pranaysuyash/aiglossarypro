# AWS App Runner Deployment Status

## üöÄ Deployment Summary

### What We've Fixed
1. **TypeScript Build Issues** ‚úÖ
   - Resolved all Express type errors
   - Fixed monorepo rootDir configuration
   - Implemented esbuild for 100x faster builds

2. **Build Optimization** ‚úÖ
   - Build time: 30-60s ‚Üí 232ms
   - Memory usage: Minimal (no more heap errors)
   - CommonJS output for App Runner compatibility

3. **Deployment Preparation** ‚úÖ
   - Added health check endpoint
   - Created comprehensive documentation
   - Set up monitoring scripts

### Current Status
- **Last Push**: All fixes pushed to `monorepo-migration` branch
- **Build System**: esbuild configured and tested
- **Health Check**: Available at `/health`

## üìä Monitoring Your Deployment

### Option 1: Use the Monitoring Script
```bash
# Set your service name
export SERVICE_NAME=aiglossarypro

# Run the monitor
./monitor-deployment.sh
```

### Option 2: AWS Console
1. Go to [AWS App Runner Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/apprunner)
2. Select your service
3. Check "Deployment" tab for status
4. View "Logs" tab for build output

### Option 3: AWS CLI
```bash
# List services
aws apprunner list-services

# Get detailed status
aws apprunner describe-service --service-arn <your-service-arn>

# View logs
aws logs tail /aws/apprunner/<service-name>/application --follow
```

## ‚úÖ Deployment Verification

Once deployment completes, run:

```bash
# Set your App Runner URL
export APP_URL=https://your-service-name.awsapprunner.com

# Run the test script
./test-deployment.sh
```

Expected results:
- Health check: HTTP 200 ‚úÖ
- API docs: Accessible ‚úÖ
- API endpoints: Responding ‚úÖ

## üîç Common Deployment Timeline

1. **Build Phase** (2-5 minutes)
   - Installing dependencies
   - Building packages
   - Running esbuild

2. **Deployment Phase** (3-5 minutes)
   - Creating new instance
   - Starting application
   - Health checks

3. **Stabilization** (1-2 minutes)
   - Traffic migration
   - Old instance termination

**Total Time**: ~10-12 minutes

## üö® If Something Goes Wrong

1. **Check Build Logs First**
   ```bash
   aws logs tail /aws/apprunner/<service-name>/build --follow
   ```

2. **Then Application Logs**
   ```bash
   aws logs tail /aws/apprunner/<service-name>/application --follow
   ```

3. **Refer to Troubleshooting**
   - See `AWS_APPRUNNER_TROUBLESHOOTING.md`
   - Check `ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES.md`

## üìà Next Steps After Successful Deployment

1. **Performance Testing**
   - Run load tests
   - Monitor response times
   - Check memory usage

2. **Security Verification**
   - Test authentication
   - Verify HTTPS
   - Check security headers

3. **Feature Testing**
   - Test core functionality
   - Verify integrations
   - Check email sending

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Monitor First Deployment Closely**
   - First deployment takes longest
   - Subsequent deployments are faster
   - Cache is built after first run

2. **Check Environment Variables**
   - Most failures are missing env vars
   - Verify in App Runner console
   - Test locally with same values

3. **Use CloudWatch Insights**
   ```sql
   fields @timestamp, @message
   | filter @message like /ERROR/
   | sort @timestamp desc
   | limit 20
   ```
