# ECS Deployment Status Report - AIGlossaryPro

**Last Updated**: August 2, 2025
**Status**: üü° **Container Exit Issue - Infrastructure Ready**

## üéØ Summary

The ECS deployment infrastructure is fully configured and working, but the Node.js application container exits immediately after starting. This is preventing the service from becoming healthy.

## ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

1. **Docker Multi-Architecture Support**
   - Created Dockerfile with proper multi-arch support
   - Built images for both ARM64 (local) and AMD64 (AWS)
   - Images successfully pushed to ECR

2. **Environment Configuration**
   - Implemented comprehensive environment validation
   - Integrated AWS Secrets Manager for sensitive variables
   - All required secrets properly stored and accessible

3. **ECS Infrastructure**
   - Cluster: `aiglossarypro` (active)
   - Service: `aiglossarypro-api` (created)
   - Task Definition: Version 4 with secrets integration
   - Security Group: Configured with port 8080 access
   - IAM Roles: Proper permissions for Secrets Manager

4. **Deployment Automation**
   - Multiple deployment scripts created
   - Cleanup scripts for failed deployments
   - Local debugging tools

## ‚ùå Current Issue

**The container starts but immediately exits without error messages**

### Symptoms:
- Container shows "Running node dist/index.js" then exits
- No error messages in CloudWatch logs
- Task remains in PENDING state
- Health checks never succeed

### Likely Causes:
1. Missing environment variables not properly validated
2. Async initialization failing silently
3. Module resolution issues in production build

## üõ†Ô∏è Created Scripts

| Script | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `scripts/docker-debug.sh` | Interactive Docker debugging with multiple options |
| `scripts/deploy-ecs-multiarch.sh` | Full multi-architecture ECS deployment |
| `scripts/deploy-ecs-production.sh` | Production deployment with Secrets Manager |
| `scripts/deploy-ecs-with-secrets.sh` | Alternative secrets deployment approach |
| `scripts/cleanup-services.sh` | Clean up Docker/ECS resources |
| `scripts/setup-secrets.sh` | Configure AWS Secrets Manager |

## üìä Infrastructure Details

```yaml
AWS Account: 927289246324
Region: us-east-1
ECR Repository: 927289246324.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/aiglossarypro-api
ECS Cluster: aiglossarypro
Service Name: aiglossarypro-api
Task Family: aiglossarypro-api
```

## üîß Immediate Actions Needed

1. **Add error handling to catch silent failures**:
   ```javascript
   // In apps/api/src/index.ts
   process.on('uncaughtException', (error) => {
     console.error('FATAL: Uncaught Exception:', error);
     process.exit(1);
   });
   ```

2. **Test locally with production config**:
   ```bash
   NODE_ENV=production ./scripts/docker-debug.sh
   ```

3. **Consider adding a process manager** like PM2 for better process control

## üìù Key Learnings

1. **Silent exits are the hardest to debug** - Always add comprehensive error logging
2. **Environment validation must be bulletproof** - The app should fail loudly if config is wrong
3. **Local testing with production config is essential** - Test exact production setup locally
4. **Multi-arch builds add complexity** - But are necessary for ARM64 dev machines

## ‚ú® Once Fixed

When the container exit issue is resolved, you'll have:
- Fully automated ECS deployment
- Multi-architecture support
- Secure secrets management
- Comprehensive monitoring
- Easy scaling capabilities

The infrastructure is ready - just need to fix the application startup issue!
