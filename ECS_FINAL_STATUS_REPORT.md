## üö® Current Issues

### Container Health Check Failures
Tasks are starting but failing health checks and being terminated:
- Tasks register with load balancer
- Health checks fail after ~2 minutes
- Tasks are drained and stopped
- Cycle repeats

### Possible Causes:
1. **Application not starting properly**
   - TypeScript errors bypassed with `SKIP_TYPE_CHECK=true`
   - Could be runtime errors

2. **Health check endpoint issues**
   - `/health` endpoint might not be responding
   - Port 8080 might not be accessible

3. **Resource constraints**
   - 256 CPU / 512 MB memory might be insufficient
   - Application might be crashing due to memory limits

---

## üîç Debugging Steps

### 1. Check Container Logs
```bash
# Get the latest task ARN
TASK_ARN=$(aws ecs list-tasks --cluster aiglossarypro --desired-status STOPPED --region us-east-1 --query 'taskArns[0]' --output text)

# View logs for that task
aws logs get-log-events \
  --log-group-name /ecs/aiglossarypro-api \
  --log-stream-name ecs/api/${TASK_ARN##*/} \
  --region us-east-1
```

### 2. Test Locally with Same Image
```bash
# Run the exact same image locally
docker run -p 8080:8080 \
  -e NODE_ENV=development \
  -e PORT=8080 \
  927289246324.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/aiglossarypro-api:latest

# Test health endpoint
curl http://localhost:8080/health
```

### 3. Increase Resources
Update task definition with more CPU/memory:
```json
{
  "cpu": "512",    // Increase from 256
  "memory": "1024" // Increase from 512
}
```

## üìä Task History Summary

Multiple task attempts, all following same pattern:
1. Task starts successfully
2. Registers with load balancer
3. Fails health checks after ~2 minutes
4. Gets drained and stopped

Recent tasks:
- `ef0c3fc1655148e99e547353954ecb72` - Started 23:20, stopped
- `9ae6041574524dc6a7ccdf3f037fb93b` - Started 23:22, stopped

## üí∞ Current Costs

**Service Stopped** (Current state)
- ALB: ~$16/month (still running)
- ECR: ~$0.10/GB/month = ~$0.05/month
- Secrets Manager: ~$3/month
- **Total**: ~$19/month

**When Running**
- Add ECS Fargate: ~$10-15/month
- **Total**: ~$29-34/month

---

## üîß Immediate Actions Needed

1. **Debug Container Startup**
   ```bash
   # Run container locally to see startup logs
   docker run -it --rm \
     -e NODE_ENV=production \
     -e PORT=8080 \
     927289246324.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/aiglossarypro-api:latest
   ```

2. **Fix TypeScript Errors**
   - Remove `SKIP_TYPE_CHECK=true` from Dockerfile
   - Fix all compilation errors
   - Rebuild and push image

3. **Check Health Endpoint**
   - Verify `/health` endpoint exists in code
   - Ensure it returns 200 OK
   - Check if it needs database connection

4. **Increase Resources**
   - Update task definition with more CPU/memory
   - Monitor resource usage

## üìù Documentation Created

1. **APP_RUNNER_COMPLETE_DOCUMENTATION.md** - Full history of App Runner failures
2. **ECS_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md** - Step-by-step migration guide
3. **ECS_DEPLOYMENT_STATUS.md** - Initial deployment status
4. **ECS_DEPLOYMENT_COMPLETE_STATUS.md** - Post-infrastructure setup status
5. **ECS_FINAL_STATUS_REPORT.md** - This final comprehensive report

---

## ‚úÖ What Works

- All AWS infrastructure is properly configured
- Docker image builds and pushes successfully
- Secrets are properly stored and accessible
- Management scripts function correctly
- Load balancer and networking are set up

## ‚ùå What Doesn't Work

- Container fails health checks and stops
- Application is not accessible via load balancer
- TypeScript errors are bypassed, not fixed

---

## üéØ Next Steps Priority

1. **HIGH**: Debug why container fails to start/stay healthy
2. **HIGH**: Fix TypeScript compilation errors
3. **MEDIUM**: Deploy frontend to S3/CloudFront
4. **LOW**: Add HTTPS/SSL certificate to ALB
5. **LOW**: Configure custom domain

---

## üìû Support Notes

The infrastructure is correctly set up. The issue is with the application container itself. Focus debugging efforts on:
- Container startup logs
- Health check endpoint functionality
- Resource constraints
- TypeScript/runtime errors

The migration from App Runner to ECS is technically complete, but the application needs fixes to run successfully.
