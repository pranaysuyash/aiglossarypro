## 🔧 Application Configuration

# Gumroad Integration
GUMROAD_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your-webhook-secret-here
GUMROAD_PRODUCT_ID=your-product-id-here
GUMROAD_PRODUCT_URL=https://yourname.gumroad.com/l/ai-ml-glossary
```

### 2. Update the Lifetime Page
Update `/client/src/pages/Lifetime.tsx` to use your actual Gumroad URL:

```typescript
// Find this line and update with your Gumroad URL
const gumroadUrl = process.env.VITE_GUMROAD_PRODUCT_URL || 'https://yourname.gumroad.com/l/ai-ml-glossary';
```

### 3. Add Environment Variable to Client
Add to your `.env` file:
```bash
# Client-side Gumroad URL
VITE_GUMROAD_PRODUCT_URL=https://yourname.gumroad.com/l/ai-ml-glossary
```

## 🧪 Testing the Integration

### 1. Test Purchase Flow
1. **Start your dev server**: `npm run dev`
2. **Navigate to**: http://localhost:3000/lifetime
3. **Click "Get Lifetime Access"** → Should redirect to Gumroad
4. **Complete test purchase** (use Gumroad's test mode)

### 2. Test Webhook
1. **Use Gumroad's webhook tester** in the dashboard
2. **Check server logs** for webhook processing
3. **Verify user gets lifetime access** in your database

### 3. Test Access Verification
1. **Purchase the product** with a test email
2. **Go to**: http://localhost:3000/lifetime
3. **Click "I already purchased"**
4. **Enter the email** used for purchase
5. **Should grant access** and update user record

## 🔐 Security & Production Setup

### 1. Webhook Security
- ✅ Already implemented: HMAC signature verification
- ✅ Already implemented: Timing-safe comparison
- ✅ Already implemented: Request logging for debugging

### 2. Production Checklist
- [ ] Update webhook URL to production domain
- [ ] Test webhook with real Gumroad purchase
- [ ] Set up Gumroad payout information
- [ ] Enable Gumroad analytics tracking
- [ ] Test refund flow

### 3. Monitoring
The system already includes:
- ✅ Webhook verification logging
- ✅ Purchase tracking in database
- ✅ Error handling and Sentry integration
- ✅ User access level management

## 📊 How It Works

### Purchase Flow
1. **User clicks** "Get Lifetime Access" → Redirected to Gumroad
2. **User completes purchase** → Gumroad processes payment
3. **Gumroad sends webhook** → Your server receives notification
4. **Server verifies webhook** → HMAC signature validated
5. **User record updated** → `lifetime_access = true` in database
6. **User gets access** → Can access premium features

### Access Verification Flow
1. **User enters email** → Server checks purchase records
2. **If purchase found** → User access granted
3. **If no purchase** → User prompted to purchase

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Webhook Not Received
- ✅ Check webhook URL is correct (https required)
- ✅ Verify webhook secret matches environment variable
- ✅ Check server logs for incoming requests
- ✅ Test webhook manually from Gumroad dashboard

### Purchase Not Granting Access
- ✅ Check webhook processing logs
- ✅ Verify email matches exactly
- ✅ Check database `purchases` table for records
- ✅ Ensure user exists in `users` table

### Development Testing
- ✅ Use Gumroad's test mode for development
- ✅ Webhook verification is relaxed in development
- ✅ Check console logs for detailed information
