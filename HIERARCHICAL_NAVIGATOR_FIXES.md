# HierarchicalNavigator Bug Fixes Summary

## Bugs Fixed

### 1. Recursive State Propagation Bug (HierarchicalNavigator.tsx, lines 191-192)

**Problem**: The recursive OutlineNode component was passing down the same `isActive` and `isExpanded` state to all child nodes, causing incorrect highlighting and expansion states.

**Fix**: 
- Changed `isActive={isActive}` to `isActive={currentPath === \`${path}.${index}\`}`
- Changed `isExpanded={isExpanded}` to `isExpanded={expandedNodes.has(\`${path}.${index}\`)}`

**Result**: Each child node now correctly calculates its own active and expanded states based on its unique path.

### 2. Depth Calculation Bug (content-structure.ts, line 58)

**Problem**: The depth calculation in `flattenStructure` function was calling `split('.')` on an empty string when `parentPath` was empty, resulting in incorrect depth values.

**Fix**: 
- Changed `const depth = parentPath.split('.').length;` to `const depth = parentPath ? parentPath.split('.').length : 0;`

**Result**: Root-level nodes now correctly have depth 0, preventing layout and styling issues.

### 3. Progress Calculation Fix (HierarchicalNavigator.tsx, lines 255-262)

**Problem**: The original progress calculation was using `Object.values(userProgress)` which didn't account for nodes that might not have progress entries, leading to inaccurate progress calculations.

**Fix**: 
- Replaced simple Object.values calculation with a more robust approach that:
  - Flattens the structure to get all nodes
  - Checks for actual progress entries by path
  - Calculates progress based on actual node completion status

**Result**: Progress calculation now accurately reflects the completion status of all nodes in the hierarchy.

## Performance Optimizations Added

### 1. React.memo for OutlineNode Component
- Wrapped the OutlineNode component with React.memo to prevent unnecessary re-renders when props haven't changed
- This is especially important for deeply nested hierarchies

### 2. useMemo for Expensive Calculations
- **filteredSections**: Memoized search filtering to prevent recalculation on every render
- **progress calculations**: Memoized the overall progress calculation to avoid repeated flatten operations
- **breadcrumbs**: Memoized breadcrumb generation to prevent recalculation
- **isInteractive**: Memoized interactive element detection
- **getIcon**: Memoized icon generation
- **getPriorityStyle**: Memoized priority styling

### 3. useCallback for Event Handlers
- The existing `handleToggle` function was already using useCallback, ensuring stable references

## Additional Improvements

### 1. Enhanced Type Safety
- Added proper prop types for `expandedNodes` and `currentPath` to the OutlineNode component
- Ensured all recursive calls pass the correct props

### 2. Better State Management
- Fixed the prop drilling issue by properly passing state through the component hierarchy
- Each node now has access to the global state needed for correct rendering

## Files Modified
