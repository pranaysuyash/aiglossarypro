const enhancedDefinition = await mcp.aiContent.enhance({
  term: "Neural Network",
  definition: originalDefinition,
  style: "beginner-friendly",
  includeExamples: true,
  includeVisuals: true
});
```

### Phase 2: Research Integration (Week 3-4)
```typescript
// Example: Academic Research MCP Integration  
const researchData = await mcp.research.findPapers({
  term: "Transformer Architecture",
  limit: 5,
  sortBy: "citations",
  yearRange: [2020, 2025]
});
```

### Phase 3: Code Examples (Month 2)
```typescript
// Example: GitHub Integration MCP
const codeExamples = await mcp.github.findImplementations({
  algorithm: "Gradient Descent",
  language: "python",
  minStars: 100,
  includeNotebooks: true
});
```
