# Monorepo Migration Status Report

## ✅ Completed Work

### Phase 1 - Foundation (100% Complete)
- ✅ Restructured codebase into monorepo architecture
- ✅ Created apps/, packages/, infrastructure/ directories
- ✅ Migrated server → apps/api, client → apps/web
- ✅ Organized 50+ markdown files into docs/reports directory
- ✅ Cleaned up legacy server/ and client/ directories

### Phase 2 - Build System (100% Complete)
- ✅ Set up pnpm workspaces for dependency management
- ✅ Created shared packages:
  - `@aiglossarypro/shared` - Types, schemas, utilities with subpath exports
  - `@aiglossarypro/database` - Database connection and queries
  - `@aiglossarypro/auth` - Authentication logic
  - `@aiglossarypro/config` - Configuration management
- ✅ Fixed all import paths to use package names
- ✅ Configured TypeScript for unbundled ESM execution
- ✅ Fixed TypeScript errors in shared package
- ✅ API starts successfully with tsx

### Phase 3 - Docker (100% Complete)
- ✅ Created monorepo-specific Dockerfiles
  - `Dockerfile.monorepo` - Full monorepo build
  - `Dockerfile.api` - API-only optimized build
- ✅ Added comprehensive health check endpoints
- ✅ Created docker-compose.yml for local testing
- ✅ Integrated health checks into Docker containers

## 🚧 Pending Work

### High Priority
1. **Fix AWS App Runner startup issues** - Debug deployment problems
2. **Update GitHub Actions for monorepo CI/CD** - Configure workflows for monorepo
3. **Create AWS App Runner deployment configuration** - Set up proper deployment
4. **Evaluate deployment platforms** - Compare ECS vs Railway vs App Runner

### Medium Priority
1. **Add README.md documentation for each package** - Document package usage
2. **Optimize Docker builds with workspace caching** - Improve build performance
3. **Implement selective deployment** - Deploy only changed packages
4. **Add package-specific test workflows** - Test individual packages
5. **Implement comprehensive logging** - Add structured logging across packages
6. **Set up error tracking and monitoring** - Configure Sentry/monitoring

### Low Priority
1. **Fix Storybook import errors in web app** - Address import/export mismatches
2. **Implement package versioning strategy** - Version packages independently

## 📝 Recent Changes

### TypeScript Fixes
- Fixed `isEnhancedError` return type issue
- Removed unused `originalMessage` parameter
- Fixed `componentStack` property placement in metadata
- Converted Express middleware types to `any` for compatibility
- Renamed `UserLearningProfile` to `UserLearningProfileData` to avoid conflicts

### Health Check Integration
- Added comprehensive health check routes registration
- Integrated with existing `/api/health` endpoint
- Added routes for:
  - `/health` - Basic health check
  - `/health/live` - Liveness probe
  - `/health/ready` - Readiness probe
  - `/health/detailed` - Comprehensive status
  - `/health/database` - Database health
  - `/health/email` - Email service health
  - `/health/analytics` - Analytics health
  - `/health/dependencies` - All dependencies

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Test API deployment locally** using `docker-compose up`
2. **Build and push Docker image** to ECR for AWS deployment
3. **Configure App Runner** with proper environment variables
4. **Set up CI/CD pipelines** for automated deployment
5. **Document deployment process** for team reference
