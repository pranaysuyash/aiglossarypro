- [ ] HTTPS enforced (App Runner provides this)
- [ ] Security headers configured (helmet.js)
- [ ] Rate limiting enabled
- [ ] CORS properly configured
- [ ] Authentication required for admin endpoints
- [ ] SQL queries use parameterized statements
- [ ] File upload restrictions in place

### üóÑÔ∏è Database
- [ ] Connection pooling configured
- [ ] Indexes created for frequent queries
- [ ] Database backups scheduled
- [ ] Connection timeout set appropriately
- [ ] SSL enabled for database connections
- [ ] Read replicas configured (if needed)

### üìä Monitoring & Logging
- [ ] Health check endpoint working (`/health`)
- [ ] Error tracking configured (Sentry)
- [ ] Application logs structured (JSON)
- [ ] CloudWatch alarms set up
- [ ] Performance metrics tracked
- [ ] Database query monitoring enabled

### üö¶ Performance
- [ ] Response caching implemented
- [ ] Database queries optimized
- [ ] Static assets served efficiently
- [ ] Compression enabled (gzip)
- [ ] Connection limits configured
- [ ] Memory usage optimized
- [ ] Build size minimized

### üì¶ Deployment
- [ ] Environment variables documented
- [ ] Build process automated (esbuild)
- [ ] Zero-downtime deployment configured
- [ ] Rollback procedure documented
- [ ] Health checks passing
- [ ] Auto-scaling configured (if needed)

## üîç Post-Deployment Verification

### Immediate Checks (First 5 minutes)
```bash
# 1. Health Check
curl -s https://your-app.awsapprunner.com/health | jq

# 2. API Response Time
time curl -s https://your-app.awsapprunner.com/api/terms | head -1

# 3. Error Rate Check
aws logs tail /aws/apprunner/your-service/application --filter-pattern "ERROR"

# 4. Memory Usage
# Check CloudWatch metrics for memory utilization
```

### First Hour Checks
- [ ] Monitor error rates in CloudWatch
- [ ] Check response times remain < 1s
- [ ] Verify database connections stable
- [ ] Confirm no memory leaks
- [ ] Test authentication flow
- [ ] Verify email sending (if applicable)

### First 24 Hours
- [ ] Review Sentry for new errors
- [ ] Check CloudWatch costs
- [ ] Monitor database performance
- [ ] Review security logs
- [ ] Test backup procedures
- [ ] Verify scheduled jobs running

## üéØ Performance Targets

| Metric | Target | Critical |
|--------|--------|----------|
| Health check response | < 200ms | < 1s |
| API response time (p95) | < 500ms | < 2s |
| Error rate | < 0.1% | < 1% |
| Uptime | > 99.9% | > 99% |
| Memory usage | < 80% | < 95% |
| CPU usage | < 70% | < 90% |

## üîß Configuration Verification

### App Runner Settings
```yaml
Instance Configuration:
  CPU: 0.25 vCPU minimum
  Memory: 0.5 GB minimum
  
Auto Scaling:
  Min instances: 1
  Max instances: 10
  Target CPU: 70%
  
Health Check:
  Path: /health
  Interval: 10 seconds
  Timeout: 5 seconds
  Healthy threshold: 1
  Unhealthy threshold: 3
```

### Critical Environment Variables
```bash
# Verify these are set in App Runner
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=8080
DATABASE_URL=<verified-connection-string>
JWT_SECRET=<32+ character secret>
SESSION_SECRET=<32+ character secret>
```

## üö® Emergency Procedures

### If deployment fails:
1. Check CloudWatch logs immediately
2. Verify environment variables
3. Test database connectivity
4. Review recent code changes
5. Rollback if necessary

### If performance degrades:
1. Check CloudWatch metrics
2. Review slow query logs
3. Check for memory leaks
4. Scale up if needed
5. Enable caching if not already

### If security incident:
1. Rotate all secrets immediately
2. Review access logs
3. Check for unauthorized API calls
4. Update security groups
5. Notify team and stakeholders
