# Monorepo Development Guide

## Current Status

The monorepo migration is partially complete. Here's what's been done:

### ✅ Completed:
1. **Monorepo Structure Created**
   - `apps/api` - Express backend
   - `apps/web` - React frontend  
   - `packages/shared` - Shared types
   - `packages/database` - Database layer
   - `packages/auth` - Authentication
   - `packages/config` - Configuration

2. **Documentation Organized**
   - 50+ markdown files moved to `docs/reports/`
   - Clean root directory

3. **Workspaces Configured**
   - `pnpm-workspace.yaml` created
   - Package dependencies linked

### ⚠️ In Progress:
1. **Import Path Updates** - Many imports still reference old locations
2. **Build System** - Need to switch from bundling to TypeScript compilation
3. **Module Resolution** - Some packages need proper exports

## Quick Start (Temporary)

Until the migration is complete, you can still run the app using the original structure:

```bash
# Run from root directory
npm run dev:basic
```

This will start both frontend and backend using the old paths.

## Full Monorepo Setup (When Complete)

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Run development
pnpm run dev

# Build all packages
pnpm run build
```

## Next Steps

1. Update all import paths in `apps/api/src` to use package imports
2. Configure unbundled ESM builds
3. Update Docker configuration for monorepo
4. Set up CI/CD for the new structure

## Benefits of This Architecture

1. **Clean Separation** - Each package has a specific purpose
2. **Better Scalability** - Easy to add new services
3. **Improved DX** - Clear structure, faster builds
4. **Platform Flexibility** - Deploy anywhere (ECS, Railway, etc.)
