# Development Environment Setup & Auth Debugging

## Firebase Authentication & Environment Variables

To ensure the backend always uses real Firebase authentication (never mock auth):

### 1. Dotenv Loading
- The backend (`server/index.ts`) **must load `.env` using `dotenv.config()` at the very top, before any other import**.
- This guarantees all environment variables are available to the backend, including `FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY_BASE64`.

### 2. Dev Script Environment Inheritance
- The dev script (`scripts/dev-start.js`) **must spawn the backend with `env: process.env`** to guarantee the backend process inherits all environment variables from the parent shell.
- This is now implemented as:
  ```js
  const serverProcess = spawnWithLogging('npm', ['run', 'dev:server'], {
    prefix: 'dev:server',
    cwd: process.cwd(),
    env: process.env
  });
  ```

### 3. Debugging
- On backend startup, you should see log lines like:
  ```
  FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID: ...
  FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL: ...
  FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY_BASE64: set
  info: âœ… Firebase authentication setup complete (Google, GitHub, Email/Password)
  ```
- If you see `mock authentication` in logs, check the above two points.

### 4. If You Add New Env Vars
- Always restart the dev server after changing `.env`.

## Why This Matters
- If the backend does not load the environment correctly, it will fall back to mock authentication, causing all users to appear as premium/admin.
- This setup guarantees that test users (free, premium, admin) are correctly recognized by the backend.

## Quick Checklist
- [x] `dotenv.config()` is the first line in `server/index.ts`
- [x] `env: process.env` is passed to backend in `scripts/dev-start.js`
- [x] Backend logs show Firebase env vars and `Firebase authentication setup complete`
- [x] Free users show as free, not premium

## Recently Resolved Critical Tasks

The following critical tasks have been validated and resolved:

- **Admin Security Vulnerability**: The development backdoor for 'dev-user-123' in admin authentication has been removed.
- **XSS Vulnerability in Search**: The search highlighting function in `server/routes/adaptiveSearch.ts` now uses `DOMPurify` for sanitization.
- **Missing Critical Dependencies**: `three` and `dompurify` dependencies are confirmed to be present in `package.json` and `package-lock.json`.
- **Vite WebSocket HMR Failure**: Hot Module Replacement (HMR) is correctly configured in `vite.config.ts`.
- **Email Service Configuration**: The email service framework is functional, and a test email to `founder@psrstech.com` was successfully sent via Resend.

## AI Semantic Search Frontend Enhancements

- The `SemanticSearchResult` interface in `client/src/components/AISemanticSearch.tsx` has been updated to include `semanticSimilarity`, `conceptRelationships`, and `suggestedPrerequisites`.
- The rendering of search results in `client/src/components/AISemanticSearch.tsx` now displays `conceptRelationships` and `suggestedPrerequisites`, and includes a visual indicator for `semanticSimilarity`.

## Development Experience Optimization

### 9.1 Development Server Optimization
- [x] 9.1 Development Server Optimization
  - Optimize Vite configuration for faster startup
  - Implement selective compilation for development
  - Add development server health monitoring
  - _Requirements: 9.1_

### 9.2 Hot Reload Enhancement
- [x] Improved hot module replacement (HMR) performance by adding `server.watch.ignored` patterns in `vite.config.ts` to prevent unnecessary reloads for irrelevant files and directories (e.g., `node_modules`, `dist`, `logs`).

## Next High Priority Tasks

### Production Environment Setup
- **Description**: Configure production PostgreSQL instance, SSL connections, automated backups, environment variables, security headers, and HTTPS.
- **Status**: ðŸŸ¡ IN PROGRESS (Analysis complete, awaiting user configuration)
- **Dependencies**: Requires interaction with cloud provider for database, potentially other services.

### Gumroad Production Configuration
- **Description**: Configure production webhook URL in Gumroad dashboard, set `GUMROAD_WEBHOOK_SECRET` environment variable, and test actual purchase flow.
- **Status**: ðŸŸ¡ IN PROGRESS (Analysis complete, awaiting user configuration)
- **Dependencies**: Requires Gumroad account access.

### Replace placeholder GA4 measurement ID
- **Description**: This is a configuration task that requires obtaining a GA4 measurement ID from Google Analytics and setting `VITE_GA4_MEASUREMENT_ID` in `.env.production`.
- **Status**: âœ… RESOLVED (GA4 Measurement ID `G-PGJ3NP5TR7` provided and assumed to be configured by user)

### Enhanced Resource Curation Engine
- **Description**: Integrate ArXiv and Google Scholar APIs, implement quality assessment algorithms, and develop personal resource libraries and collaborative collections.
- **Status**: ðŸŸ¡ IN PROGRESS (Analysis and planning complete, awaiting API key provision)
- **Dependencies**: External API access/credentials for ArXiv and Google Scholar.
