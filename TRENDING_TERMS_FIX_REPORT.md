# Trending Terms API Fix Report

## Issue Summary
The trending terms query was failing because it was trying to reference a non-existent `term_analytics` table and incorrectly importing `userInteractions` table which doesn't exist in the database.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Missing Table**: The code was trying to join with `termAnalytics` table which wasn't available
2. **Incorrect Import**: Using `userInteractions` from schema but the actual table is `term_views`
3. **Database Schema Mismatch**: The trending.ts file was written for a different database structure

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated Database Table References
- **Before**: Used `termAnalytics` and `userInteractions` 
- **After**: Using `terms.viewCount` and `termViews` table

### 2. Fixed Query Structure
```typescript
// OLD (failing)
.leftJoin(termAnalytics, eq(terms.id, termAnalytics.termId))
viewCount: sql<number>`COALESCE(${termAnalytics.viewCount}, 0)`

// NEW (working)
viewCount: sql<number>`COALESCE(${terms.viewCount}, 0)`
```

### 3. Updated Interaction Tracking
```typescript
// OLD (failing)
recentViews: sql<number>`
  COALESCE(
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM ${userInteractions} 
     WHERE ${userInteractions.termId} = ${terms.id} 
     AND ${userInteractions.interactionType} = 'view'
     AND ${userInteractions.timestamp} >= ${startTime.toISOString()}), 
    0
  )`

// NEW (working)
recentViews: sql<number>`
  COALESCE(
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM ${termViews} 
     WHERE ${termViews.termId} = ${terms.id} 
     AND ${termViews.viewedAt} >= ${startTime.toISOString()}), 
    0
  )`
```

### 4. Simplified Unavailable Features
For features that depend on tables that don't exist:
- `averageTimeSpent`: Set to 0 (no duration tracking in term_views)
- `shareCount`: Set to 0 (no share tracking available)
- `bookmarkCount`: Set to 0 (no bookmark tracking available)

## Database Schema Verification
Confirmed existing tables:
- ✅ `terms` (with `view_count` column)
- ✅ `term_views` (with `user_id`, `term_id`, `viewed_at`)
- ✅ `categories` (for category joins)
- ❌ `user_interactions` (doesn't exist)
- ❌ `term_analytics` (doesn't exist)

## API Endpoints Fixed

### 1. GET /api/trending/terms
- **Status**: ✅ Working
- **Response**: Returns trending terms based on view_count and recent views
- **Example**:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": [],
  "filters": {
    "timeRange": "day",
    "trendType": "popular",
    "limit": 20,
    "offset": 0
  },
  "pagination": {
    "limit": 20,
    "offset": 0,
    "total": 0
  }
}
```

### 2. GET /api/trending/analytics
- **Status**: ✅ Working
- **Response**: Returns trending analytics summary
- **Example**:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "totalTrendingTerms": 0,
    "averageVelocityScore": 0,
    "topCategories": [],
    "trendingChangeFromPrevious": 0
  },
  "timeRange": "day"
}
```

### 3. GET /api/trending/categories
- **Status**: ✅ Working
- **Response**: Returns trending categories based on term views

### 4. POST /api/trending/interaction
- **Status**: ✅ Working (for 'view' interactions only)
- **Behavior**: Records views in `term_views` table
