**Performance Monitoring:**
- `performance` object with pageLoadTime, apiResponseTime, renderTime, memoryUsage

**Analytics Tracking:**
- `analytics` object with sessionDuration, pageViews, lastInteraction, referrer

**Content Management:**
- `content` object tracking termId, categoryId, searchQuery, contentType

**Admin Features:**
- `adminAction` object for tracking create/update/delete operations with entity details

**Device Information:**
- `device` object with type, OS, browser, screen resolution, connection type

### 2. Enhanced Storage Methods (`server/enhancedStorage.ts`)
Added missing methods with rich functionality:

**`createEnhancedTerm`:**
- Adds analytics tracking (views, ratings, user engagement)
- Performance metrics (load time, render time, search rank)
- Content management metadata (status, version, SEO metadata)

**`createTermSection`:**
- User experience enhancements (reading time, difficulty assessment)

**`createInteractiveElement`:**
- Interaction tracking (interactions, completions, errors)
- Performance metrics (load time, interaction time)
- Compatibility information

**`getEnhancedTermsStats`:**
- Comprehensive statistics including content quality metrics
- User engagement data

### 3. Analytics Event Enhancement (`client/src/types/analytics.ts`)
Expanded `AnalyticsEvent` interface with:

**User Experience:**
- user_id, session_id, user_type, engagement_time, interaction_type

**Performance Monitoring:**
- page_load_time, api_response_time, render_time, time_to_interactive

**Content Tracking:**
- content_id, content_type, content_category, search metrics

**Error Tracking:**
- error_type, error_message, error_stack

**A/B Testing:**
- experiment_id, variant_id

**Device/Environment:**
- device_type, browser, OS, screen_resolution, connection_type

**Admin Features:**
- admin_action, bulk_action_count, filter_criteria

### 4. Content Structure Enhancement (`client/src/types/content-structure.ts`)
Enhanced `ContentNode` interface with:

**User Experience:**
- Difficulty levels, learning objectives, key takeaways, practical examples

**Analytics:**
- Views, completions, average time spent, user ratings

**Performance:**
- Load time, render time, error rate

**Content Management:**
- Author, review status, version control, change log

**SEO/Discovery:**
- Keywords, meta description, OG image, canonical URL

**Accessibility:**
- Alt texts, ARIA labels, transcripts

**Admin Features:**
- Access levels, expiration dates, custom permissions

**User Interactions:**

**Distribution:**
- Score ranges with counts and percentages

**Category Breakdown:**
- Per-category analytics with top issues

**User Engagement:**
- Views, feedback, share, and bookmark rates per term

**Performance Metrics:**
