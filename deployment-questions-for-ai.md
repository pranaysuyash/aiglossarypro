# AWS App Runner Deployment Issues - Questions for Claude/ChatGPT

## Context
We have a Node.js monorepo application (using pnpm workspaces) that we're trying to deploy to AWS App Runner. The build succeeds but the runtime container keeps exiting with code 1.

## Technical Setup
- **Monorepo Structure**: 
  - `/apps/api` - Express.js API
  - `/packages/shared`, `/packages/database`, `/packages/auth`, `/packages/config` - Shared packages
- **Database**: Neon Database (PostgreSQL-compatible serverless)
- **Build System**: TypeScript compiled to CommonJS
- **Package Manager**: pnpm with workspaces
- **Current Branch**: monorepo-migration

## What We've Tried
1. Fixed TypeScript compilation errors
2. Converted from ESM to CommonJS for compatibility
3. Added all required environment variables
4. Installed production dependencies in post-build phase
5. Created minimal test server to isolate issues
6. Simplified runtime command from complex shell to: `node dist/test-minimal.js`

## Current apprunner.yaml Key Parts
```yaml
runtime: nodejs18
build:
  commands:
    build:
      - pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
      - cp package.deploy.json package.json  # Switch to CommonJS
      - pnpm --filter @aiglossarypro/* run build  # Build packages
      - pnpm run build  # Build API
    post-build:
      - rm -rf node_modules
      - pnpm install --no-frozen-lockfile  # Runtime deps
run:
  command: node dist/test-minimal.js
  env:
    - DATABASE_URL, SESSION_SECRET, JWT_SECRET, etc.
```

## Persistent Issue
- Build succeeds (can see compiled files)
- Runtime container starts then immediately exits with code 1
- No application logs appear
- Health check never gets hit

## Questions

1. **App Runner Limitations**: Are there known issues with App Runner and monorepo structures? Should we be using a different AWS service for a pnpm monorepo?

2. **Container Architecture**: The user has a Mac M3 (ARM64). Could there be architecture compatibility issues between local development and AWS App Runner's x86_64 containers?

3. **Alternative Services**: Given these persistent issues, which AWS service would be better for a Node.js monorepo:
   - ECS with Fargate?
   - Elastic Beanstalk?
   - EC2 with PM2?
   - Lambda (if we refactor to serverless)?

4. **Debugging Approach**: App Runner provides minimal runtime logs. How can we better debug why the container exits immediately? Should we:
   - Add a wrapper script that logs more details?
   - Use a different base image?
   - Deploy to ECS first for better debugging?

5. **Monorepo Deployment Strategy**: For AWS deployments of pnpm monorepos, should we:
   - Build a single Docker image with all packages?
   - Deploy only the built API without the monorepo structure?
   - Use a different build approach?

6. **Success Pattern**: Have you seen successful App Runner deployments with:
   - pnpm workspaces?
   - TypeScript monorepos?
   - Neon Database connections?

What's your recommendation for the most reliable way to deploy this monorepo to AWS?
