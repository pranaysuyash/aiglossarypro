# AWS Deployment Issue Summary

## Current Status: Environment Variable Validation Failure

The deployment to AWS App Runner is failing because the server has strict environment variable validation that crashes on startup when variables are missing.

## Root Cause

Location: `server/config.ts:122-126`

The server throws an error if any required environment variables are missing:
```typescript
if (errors.length > 0) {
  logger.error('Environment validation failed:');
  errors.forEach(error => logger.error(`  - ${error}`));
  throw new Error(`Environment validation failed: ${errors.join(', ')}`);
}
```

## What Was Fixed âœ…

1. **Module Format Issues**: 
   - Converted to CommonJS format
   - Fixed tailwind.config.ts and postcss.config.js
   - Removed "type": "module" from package.json

2. **Docker Build**:
   - Added NODE_ENV and PORT to Dockerfile
   - Successfully built and pushed to ECR

3. **AWS Infrastructure**:
   - App Runner service configured with all environment variables
   - ECR repository set up correctly

## What Needs Fixing ðŸ”§

The server needs to be modified to:
1. Start with minimal required variables
2. Log warnings instead of crashing for optional variables
3. Properly receive environment variables from App Runner

## Quick Fix Options

1. **Modify server/config.ts** to be less strict in production
2. **Add default values** for all optional services
3. **Create a minimal startup mode** that only requires DATABASE_URL and SESSION_SECRET
