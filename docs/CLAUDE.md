## Development Workflow

### Branching Strategy

**Parallel Development Protocol**: Since both Claude and Gemini work on the codebase simultaneously, we use feature branches to prevent conflicts:

```bash
# Claude branches
git checkout -b claude/feature-name       # For Claude's work
git checkout -b claude/fixes-batch-1      # For multiple fixes

# Gemini branches  
git checkout -b gemini/feature-name       # For Gemini's work

# Process
1. Create feature branch from main
2. Commit changes to feature branch
3. Push feature branch to remote
4. Create PR to merge into main
5. Review for conflicts before merging
```

**Latest Completed**: `main` - ✅ CRITICAL SECURITY FIXES COMPLETE

**Progress**:

- ✅ SQL injection vulnerabilities eliminated (parameterized queries)
- ✅ File upload security hardened (magic number validation, path traversal protection)
- ✅ Storage layer consolidated (fixed getTrendingTerms crash)
- ✅ Route registration error handling added
- ✅ Accessibility features verified (WCAG compliant)
- ✅ Performance optimized (server-side pagination, caching)
- ✅ Monitoring systems operational (Winston logging, Sentry)
- 🔄 Next: Revenue optimization with $249 pricing strategy

## Build and Development Commands

### Development

```bash
npm run dev              # Start development server (auto-login as dev@example.com)
npm run db:push          # Push database schema changes
npm run db:studio        # Open Drizzle Studio
npm run db:indexes       # Apply performance indexes
npm run import:optimized # Import large datasets
```

### Production Dataset Processing

```bash
# For large Excel files (>100MB), convert to CSV first:
ssconvert data/aiml.xlsx data/aiml.csv

# Then process with streaming:
npx tsx csv_streaming_processor.ts  # Handles unlimited file size
```

### Testing

```bash
npm test                 # Run all tests
npm run test:unit        # Unit tests only
npm run test:component   # Component tests only
npm run test:coverage    # With coverage report
```

## Architecture Overview

### Database Schema

- **Base Tables**: users, terms, categories, favorites
- **Enhanced Tables**: enhanced_terms, term_sections (42-section architecture)
- **Analytics**: user_term_views, content_analytics, ai_usage_analytics
- **Monetization**: purchases, revenue tracking (16 methods operational)
- **Authentication**: JWT-based sessions with OAuth integration

### API Structure

```
/api/
├── auth/           # Authentication endpoints
├── terms/          # Term CRUD operations
├── categories/     # Category management
├── admin/          # Admin features (content, revenue, users)
├── monitoring/     # System health
├── analytics/      # Usage analytics
└── media/          # File uploads
```

### Key Technologies

- **Frontend**: React 18, TypeScript, Vite, shadcn/ui, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, Drizzle ORM
- **Database**: Neon PostgreSQL with full-text search
- **Auth**: Cost-free JWT + OAuth (Google/GitHub) with dev mock fallback
- **Monetization**: Gumroad integration with webhooks

## Critical Notes

### Environment Variables

Required:

- `DATABASE_URL`: PostgreSQL connection string
- `SESSION_SECRET`: Session encryption key
- `JWT_SECRET`: JWT token signing key
- `NODE_ENV`: development/production
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: For AI features

Optional (Cost-free OAuth):

- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` & `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`: Google OAuth
- `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` & `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET`: GitHub OAuth

### Security Considerations

- ⚠️ **URGENT**: Add `requireAdmin` middleware to 7 unprotected admin endpoints
- Rate limiting: 50 terms/day for new users (7-day grace period)
- Session-based authentication with secure cookies
- Input validation using Zod schemas

### Performance Optimizations

- Database indexes on frequently queried fields
- Query caching with memoization
- React component optimization (React.memo, useCallback, useMemo)
- Lazy loading for heavy components

### Common Development Tasks

#### Database Access

```bash
# Drizzle Studio (recommended)
npm run db:studio

# Direct access
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM terms;"
```

#### Adding New API Endpoints

1. Create route handler in `server/routes/`
2. Register in `server/routes/index.ts`
3. Add types to `shared/types.ts`
4. Update API client in `client/src/lib/api.ts`

#### Debugging Issues

```bash
# Check database connectivity
NODE_ENV=development node -e "
const { Pool } = require('@neondatabase/serverless');
const pool = new Pool({ connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL });
pool.query('SELECT 1 as test').then(console.log).catch(console.error);
"

# Monitor performance
npm run dev 2>&1 | grep -E "(database|error|connection)"
```

## Monetization System

### Implementation

- **Pricing**: $249 lifetime access with PPP discounts (optimization pending)
- **Platform**: Gumroad with webhook integration
- **Protection**: Rate limiting prevents bulk scraping
- **Tracking**: Complete revenue analytics dashboard

### Key Endpoints

```
/api/admin/revenue/dashboard     # Revenue overview
/api/admin/revenue/purchases     # Purchase management
/api/admin/revenue/analytics     # Revenue analytics
/api/gumroad/webhook            # Purchase webhook
```

Never work on your own branch, commit all changes using git add .  and only exclude what is not needed using gitignore and then make sure everything committed is pushed to remote if no breaking issues.
Suggestions when provided in cli should also be documented
Always create a separate review doc if you feel a second set of eyes would be helpful especially while we are working with multiple agents in parallel.
