## Development Workflow

### Branching Strategy

**Parallel Development Protocol**: Since both Claude and Gemini work on the codebase simultaneously, we use feature branches to prevent conflicts:

```bash
# Claude branches
git checkout -b claude/feature-name       # For Claude's work
git checkout -b claude/fixes-batch-1      # For multiple fixes

# Gemini branches  
git checkout -b gemini/feature-name       # For Gemini's work

# Process
1. Create feature branch from main
2. Commit changes to feature branch
3. Push feature branch to remote
4. Create PR to merge into main
5. Review for conflicts before merging
```

**Latest Completed**: `main` - ✅ CRITICAL SECURITY FIXES COMPLETE

**Progress**:

- ✅ SQL injection vulnerabilities eliminated (parameterized queries)
- ✅ File upload security hardened (magic number validation, path traversal protection)
- ✅ Storage layer consolidated (fixed getTrendingTerms crash)

- ✅ Accessibility features verified (WCAG compliant)
- ✅ Performance optimized (server-side pagination, caching)
- ✅ Monitoring systems operational (Winston logging, Sentry)
- 🔄 Next: Revenue optimization with $249 pricing strategy

## 🚨 IMPORTANT: Using Gemini CLI for Large Codebase Analysis

**⚠️ DO NOT DELETE THIS SECTION - CRITICAL FOR CODEBASE VERIFICATION ⚠️**

When analyzing large codebases or multiple files that might exceed context limits, use the Gemini CLI with its massive context window. Use `gemini -p` to leverage Google Gemini's large context capacity.

### File and Directory Inclusion Syntax

Use the `@` syntax to include files and directories in your Gemini prompts. The paths should be relative to WHERE you run the gemini command:

#### Examples:

**Single file analysis:**
```bash
gemini -p "@src/main.py Explain this file's purpose and structure"
```

**Multiple files:**
```bash
gemini -p "@package.json @src/index.js Analyze the dependencies used in the code"
```

**Entire directory:**
```bash
gemini -p "@src/ Summarize the architecture of this codebase"
```

**Multiple directories:**
```bash
gemini -p "@src/ @tests/ Analyze test coverage for the source code"
```

**Current directory and subdirectories:**
```bash
gemini -p "@./ Give me an overview of this entire project"
# Or use --all_files flag:
gemini --all_files -p "Analyze the project structure and dependencies"
```

### Implementation Verification Examples

**Check if a feature is implemented:**
```bash
gemini -p "@src/ @lib/ Has dark mode been implemented in this codebase? Show me the relevant files and functions"
```

**Verify authentication implementation:**
```bash
gemini -p "@src/ @middleware/ Is JWT authentication implemented? List all auth-related endpoints and middleware"
```

**Check for specific patterns:**
```bash
gemini -p "@src/ Are there any React hooks that handle WebSocket connections? List them with file paths"
```

**Verify error handling:**
```bash
gemini -p "@src/ @api/ Is proper error handling implemented for all API endpoints? Show examples of try-catch blocks"
```

**Check for rate limiting:**
```bash
gemini -p "@backend/ @middleware/ Is rate limiting implemented for the API? Show the implementation details"
```

**Verify caching strategy:**
```bash
gemini -p "@src/ @lib/ @services/ Is Redis caching implemented? List all cache-related functions and their usage"
```

**Check for specific security measures:**
```bash
gemini -p "@src/ @api/ Are SQL injection protections implemented? Show how user inputs are sanitized"
```

**Verify test coverage for features:**
```bash
gemini -p "@src/payment/ @tests/ Is the payment processing module fully tested? List all test cases"
```

### When to Use Gemini CLI

Use `gemini -p` when:
- Analyzing entire codebases or large directories
- Comparing multiple large files
- Need to understand project-wide patterns or architecture
- Current context window is insufficient for the task
- Working with files totaling more than 100KB
- Verifying if specific features, patterns, or security measures are implemented
- Checking for the presence of certain coding patterns across the entire codebase

### Important Notes

- Paths in @ syntax are relative to your current working directory when invoking gemini
- The CLI will include file contents directly in the context
- No need for --yolo flag for read-only analysis
- Gemini's context window can handle entire codebases that would overflow Claude's context
- When checking implementations, be specific about what you're looking for to get accurate results

## Build and Development Commands

### Development

```bash
npm run dev              # Start development server (auto-login as dev@example.com)
npm run db:push          # Push database schema changes
npm run db:studio        # Open Drizzle Studio
npm run db:indexes       # Apply performance indexes
npm run import:optimized # Import large datasets
```

### Production Dataset Processing

```bash
# For large Excel files (>100MB), convert to CSV first:
ssconvert data/aiml.xlsx data/aiml.csv

# Then process with streaming:
npx tsx csv_streaming_processor.ts  # Handles unlimited file size
```

### Testing

```bash
npm test                 # Run all tests
npm run test:unit        # Unit tests only
npm run test:component   # Component tests only
npm run test:coverage    # With coverage report
```

## Architecture Overview

### Database Schema

- **Base Tables**: users, terms, categories, favorites
- **Enhanced Tables**: enhanced_terms, term_sections (42-section architecture)
- **Analytics**: user_term_views, content_analytics, ai_usage_analytics
- **Monetization**: purchases, revenue tracking (16 methods operational)
- **Authentication**: JWT-based sessions with OAuth integration

### API Structure

```
/api/
├── auth/           # Authentication endpoints
├── terms/          # Term CRUD operations
├── categories/     # Category management
├── admin/          # Admin features (content, revenue, users)
├── monitoring/     # System health
├── analytics/      # Usage analytics
└── media/          # File uploads
```

### Key Technologies

- **Frontend**: React 18, TypeScript, Vite, shadcn/ui, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, Drizzle ORM
- **Database**: Neon PostgreSQL with full-text search
- **Auth**: Cost-free JWT + OAuth (Google/GitHub) with dev mock fallback
- **Monetization**: Gumroad integration with webhooks

## Critical Notes

### Environment Variables

Required:

- `DATABASE_URL`: PostgreSQL connection string
- `SESSION_SECRET`: Session encryption key
- `JWT_SECRET`: JWT token signing key
- `NODE_ENV`: development/production
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: For AI features

Optional (Cost-free OAuth):

- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` & `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`: Google OAuth
- `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` & `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET`: GitHub OAuth

### Security Considerations

- ✅ **COMPLETED**: All critical admin endpoints now properly secured with `requireAdmin` middleware
- Rate limiting: 50 terms/day for new users (7-day grace period)
- Session-based authentication with secure cookies
- Input validation using Zod schemas

### Performance Optimizations

- Database indexes on frequently queried fields
- Query caching with memoization
- React component optimization (React.memo, useCallback, useMemo)
- Lazy loading for heavy components

### Common Development Tasks

#### Database Access

```bash
# Drizzle Studio (recommended)
npm run db:studio

# Direct access
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM terms;"
```

#### Adding New API Endpoints

1. Create route handler in `server/routes/`
2. Register in `server/routes/index.ts`
3. Add types to `shared/types.ts`
4. Update API client in `client/src/lib/api.ts`

#### Debugging Issues

```bash
# Check database connectivity
NODE_ENV=development node -e "
const { Pool } = require('@neondatabase/serverless');
const pool = new Pool({ connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL });
pool.query('SELECT 1 as test').then(console.log).catch(console.error);
"

# Monitor performance
npm run dev 2>&1 | grep -E "(database|error|connection)"
```

## Monetization System

### Implementation

- **Pricing**: $249 lifetime access with PPP discounts (optimization pending)
- **Platform**: Gumroad with webhook integration
- **Protection**: Rate limiting prevents bulk scraping
- **Tracking**: Complete revenue analytics dashboard

### Key Endpoints

```
/api/admin/revenue/dashboard     # Revenue overview
/api/admin/revenue/purchases     # Purchase management
/api/admin/revenue/analytics     # Revenue analytics
/api/gumroad/webhook            # Purchase webhook
```
