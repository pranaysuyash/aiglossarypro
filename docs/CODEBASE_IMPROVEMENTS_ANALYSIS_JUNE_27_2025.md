### 62. `client/src/components/landing/Pricing.tsx`

**Overall Observation:**
This component displays the pricing section of the landing page, including a comparison table, pricing cards, and a value proposition.

**Analysis:**

1.  **Hardcoded Pricing Data (Indirectly):** **Not Implemented.** This component indirectly relies on the hardcoded `pppData` and `basePrice` in `useCountryPricing.ts` (via `PPPBanner` and `PriceDisplay`). As noted in the analysis of `useCountryPricing.ts`, this data should be moved to a configurable source.
    *   **[TASK: Claude]** Ensure the `pppData` and `basePrice` are fetched from a configurable source, as recommended in `client/src/hooks/useCountryPricing.ts` analysis.
    *   **Justification:** Allows for easier updates to pricing and PPP data without requiring code changes and redeployments.

2.  **Hardcoded Comparison Data:** **Not Implemented.** The `comparison` array contains hardcoded feature comparisons and pricing for free, competitors, and the product itself.
    *   **[REVIEW: Claude]** Consider moving this comparison data to a configurable source (e.g., a static JSON file or a backend API) if it's expected to change frequently or needs to be localized.
    *   **Justification:** Improves maintainability and flexibility.

3.  **Magic Strings (Text Content):** **Not Implemented.** Various text content throughout the component (e.g., "Simple, Fair Pricing", "Why pay $300-600 annually...", "Best Value", "Lifetime updates") are hardcoded strings.
    *   **[REVIEW: Claude]** Consider centralizing these strings for easier internationalization (i18n) if multi-language support is planned.
    *   **Justification:** Improves maintainability and prepares for i18n.

4.  **Gumroad URL:** **Not Implemented.** The Gumroad product URL (`https://gumroad.com/l/aiml-glossary-pro`) is hardcoded.
    *   **[TASK: Claude]** Move the Gumroad product URL to a configurable source (e.g., an environment variable or a central configuration file).
    *   **Justification:** Allows for easier updates to the Gumroad link without requiring code changes.

5.  **Analytics Tracking:** **Implemented.** The "Get Access" button includes Google Analytics (`gtag`) event tracking for `purchase_intent`.
    *   **[REVIEW: Claude]** Ensure that the analytics tracking is comprehensive and accurately captures user interactions with the pricing section.
    *   **Justification:** Provides valuable insights into user behavior and monetization.

6.  **UI Components:** **Implemented.** Shadcn UI components (`Card`, `Button`, `Badge`, `Check`, `ArrowRight`, `X`, `DollarSign`) are used, providing a consistent and modern UI.

7.  **Test Purchase Button:** **Implemented.** The `TestPurchaseButton` component is included, which is useful for development and testing.
