## üìû NEXT STEPS

### Immediate (Next 24 hours)
1. **Choose email provider** and sign up for service
2. **Set up production environment** variables
3. **Test current systems** end-to-end in staging

### This Week
1. **Integrate email service** (SendGrid/AWS SES)
2. **Import production content** via admin dashboard
3. **Configure production monitoring** (Sentry basics)
4. **Test payment flows** in production environment

### Launch Week
1. **Deploy to production** with basic monitoring
2. **Invite limited beta users** for testing
