- Keyboard navigation and accessibility
- Visual distinction between terms and categories
- Direct navigation to term details or category searches
- Debounced queries for performance

### 3. Batch AI Operations ✅ **COMPLETED**

**Problem:** Batch AI tools were placeholders with "coming soon" messages.

**Solution Implemented:**
- Added `/api/admin/batch/categorize` endpoint for AI-powered term categorization
- Added `/api/admin/batch/enhance-definitions` endpoint for bulk definition improvement
- Enhanced AI Tools page with functional batch operation interfaces
- Rate limiting and error handling for AI API calls

**Files Modified:**
- `server/routes/admin.ts` - Added comprehensive batch operation endpoints

- **Definition Enhancement:** Improve up to 20 definitions with customizable options
- **Smart Processing:** Rate limiting, error handling, progress tracking
- **Admin Integration:** Direct links to admin panel for batch operations

### 4. Random & Featured Term Functionality ✅ **COMPLETED**

**Problem:** Featured term functionality was mentioned but not implemented.

**Solution Implemented:**
- Added `/api/terms/random` endpoint for term discovery
- Added `/api/terms/featured` endpoint with date-based "term of the day"
- Added `/api/terms/:id/suggestions` for related term recommendations
- Intelligent algorithms for term selection and relationships

**Files Modified:**
- `server/routes/terms.ts` - Added random, featured, and suggestion endpoints

**Features:**
- **Random Terms:** Optional category filtering for focused discovery
- **Featured Term:** Consistent daily featured term using date-based seeding
- **Smart Suggestions:** Category-related and conceptually-related term recommendations
- **Rich Metadata:** Additional context and reasoning for featured selections
