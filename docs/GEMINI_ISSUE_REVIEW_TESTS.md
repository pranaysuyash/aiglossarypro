# Gemini Issue Review: Test Configuration

**Date**: June 26, 2025
**Issue**: Test suite configuration looking for Storybook tests

## Summary
The test configuration in `vitest.config.ts` is set up to run Storybook tests, but no Storybook stories exist in the project. This causes test runs to fail.

## Current Status
- Application is working correctly (verified via health check endpoint)
- CLAUDE.md successfully optimized from 73.2k to 5.9k characters (92% reduction)
- Development server runs without issues
- API endpoints respond correctly

## Test Configuration Issue
```
No story files found for the specified pattern: client/src/components/**/*.mdx
```

The vitest configuration includes the `storybookTest` plugin which expects Storybook story files, but the project has standard test files:
- tests/unit/api.test.ts
- tests/unit/auth.test.ts
- tests/unit/storage.test.ts
- tests/component/TermCard.test.tsx
- tests/integration/app.test.ts

## Recommendation
Either:
1. Remove the Storybook test configuration from vitest.config.ts
2. Or create a separate test configuration for unit tests
3. Or add actual Storybook stories to match the configuration

## Verification
The application functionality was verified:
- Server starts successfully on port 3001
- Health check endpoint returns healthy status
- Database connection is working
- All API routes are registered correctly
