# Gemini Review: Security Endpoints Verification

**Date**: June 26, 2025
**Task**: Verify admin endpoint security

## Summary
Investigated reported missing authentication on 7 admin endpoints as mentioned in CLAUDE.md.

## Findings

### Endpoints Checked

#### crossReference.ts
- Line 79: `/api/cross-reference/term/:termId/update-links` - ✅ HAS `requireAdmin`
- Line 116: `/api/cross-reference/bulk-process` - ✅ HAS `requireAdmin`
- Line 167: `/api/cross-reference/analytics` - ✅ HAS `requireAdmin`

#### feedback.ts
- Line 203: `/api/feedback` - ✅ HAS `requireAdmin`
- Line 287: `/api/feedback/:feedbackId` - ✅ HAS `requireAdmin`

#### monitoring.ts
- Line 87: `/api/monitoring/errors` - ✅ HAS `requireAdmin`
- Line 252: `/api/monitoring/metrics` - ✅ HAS `requireAdmin`

## Conclusion
All admin endpoints appear to already have proper `requireAdmin` middleware applied. The security issue mentioned in CLAUDE.md may have been resolved in a previous commit.

## Verification Method
```bash
grep -n "app\." server/routes/feedback.ts | grep -E "(get|post|put|delete|patch)" | grep -v "requireAdmin"
```

This command shows only public endpoints that don't require admin authentication, which is expected for user-facing endpoints like:
- `/api/feedback/term/:termId` - Public POST for user feedback
- `/api/feedback/general` - Public POST for general feedback

## Recommendation
The security authentication appears to be properly implemented. The documentation in CLAUDE.md may need to be updated to reflect the current state.
