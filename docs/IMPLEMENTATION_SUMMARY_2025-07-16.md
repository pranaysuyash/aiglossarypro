- Webhook signatures use HMAC for verification

3. **Email Delivery**: Instant with Resend API
4. **Analytics**: Minimal impact with async loading

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Deploy to production server** (aiglossarypro.com)
2. **Configure DNS records**
3. **Install SSL certificate**
4. **Test payment flow end-to-end**
5. **Monitor analytics and performance**

## 💡 Domain Deployment Explanation

**"Domain not deployed"** means:
- The domain `aiglossarypro.com` exists but isn't pointing to your application yet
- The code is ready but not running on a live server
- DNS records need to be configured to point to your hosting provider
- The application needs to be deployed to a hosting service (Vercel, Railway, AWS, etc.)

### To deploy:
1. Choose a hosting provider (e.g., Vercel, Railway, Render)
2. Deploy the application
3. Update DNS records to point aiglossarypro.com to your hosting
4. Configure SSL certificate
5. Test all integrations in production

## 🔧 Current Environment Variables

All critical production variables are configured in `.env.production`:
- ✅ Database connection
- ✅ Firebase authentication
- ✅ Email service (Resend)
- ✅ Payment processing (Gumroad)
- ✅ Redis caching (Upstash)
- ✅ Analytics (GA4)

The application is **production-ready** and waiting for deployment!
