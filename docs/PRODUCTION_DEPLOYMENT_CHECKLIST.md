## üß™ Production Testing Protocol

### 1. System Health Tests
```bash
# Health check
curl https://your-domain.com/api/health

# Database connectivity
curl https://your-domain.com/api/health/database

# External service connectivity  
curl https://your-domain.com/api/health/services

# Performance baseline
curl -w "@curl-format.txt" https://your-domain.com/
```
- [ ] Health endpoints respond correctly
- [ ] Database connectivity confirmed
- [ ] External services accessible
- [ ] Response times within acceptable limits

### 2. Authentication Flow Tests
```bash
# Authentication endpoint (should redirect to OAuth)
curl -v https://your-domain.com/api/login

# Verify no development endpoints
curl https://your-domain.com/api/auth/user
# Should return 401 or redirect, NOT dev user data

# Test protected endpoints
curl https://your-domain.com/api/admin/users
# Should require authentication
```

#### OAuth Flow Verification
1. Visit production URL
2. Click login/authenticate
3. Should redirect to configured OAuth provider
4. Complete OAuth flow
5. Should redirect back to app
6. Verify user session is created
7. Test logout functionality
8. Verify session is destroyed

### 3. API Security Tests
```bash
# Test rate limiting
for i in {1..20}; do curl https://your-domain.com/api/search; done

# Test CORS
curl -H "Origin: https://malicious-site.com" https://your-domain.com/api/health

# Test security headers
curl -I https://your-domain.com/

# Test input validation
curl -X POST https://your-domain.com/api/search -d '{"query": "<script>alert(1)</script>"}'
```

### 4. Performance Tests
```bash
# Load testing (basic)
ab -n 100 -c 10 https://your-domain.com/

# Database query performance
curl https://your-domain.com/api/search?q=machine+learning

# Cache performance
curl https://your-domain.com/api/terms/popular
```

### 5. External Service Integration Tests
```bash
# OpenAI API (if configured)
curl -X POST https://your-domain.com/api/ai/explain -d '{"term": "neural network"}'

# Payment webhook (if configured)
curl -X POST https://your-domain.com/api/webhooks/gumroad -d '{"test": "data"}'

# Email service (if configured)
curl -X POST https://your-domain.com/api/admin/newsletter/test
```

## üîÑ Emergency Rollback Procedures

### Critical System Failure Response

#### Immediate Actions (0-5 minutes)
```bash
# Check system status
npm run setup:production-check

# Verify environment variables
echo $NODE_ENV
echo $DATABASE_URL
echo $CORS_ORIGIN

# Quick health check
curl https://your-domain.com/api/health

# Check process status
ps aux | grep node
```

#### Emergency Rollback Options (5-15 minutes)

##### Option 1: Git Revert
```bash
# Revert to previous working deployment
git revert <failed-commit-hash>
npm run build
npm run start

# Or with PM2
pm2 restart aiglossary-prod
```

##### Option 2: Environment Fix
```bash
# Correct environment variables
cp .env.production.backup .env.production
npm run setup:production-check
pm2 restart aiglossary-prod
```

##### Option 3: Emergency Maintenance Mode
```bash
# Temporarily redirect traffic to maintenance page
# Update load balancer/reverse proxy configuration
# Or serve static maintenance page
```

### Database Rollback (if needed)
```bash
# Restore from backup
pg_restore -d production_db backup_file.sql

# Or rollback specific migrations
npm run db:rollback
```

### Rollback Verification
- [ ] Application starts without errors
- [ ] Database connectivity restored
- [ ] Authentication working
- [ ] Core features functional
- [ ] No data loss confirmed

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Deployment Mistakes

### Configuration Errors
- **Missing REPLIT_DOMAINS**: Results in mock auth being used
- **Wrong REPL_ID**: OAuth flow fails
- **Development SESSION_SECRET**: Security vulnerability
- **Mixed environment variables**: Unpredictable behavior

### Database Issues
- **Missing admin users**: No admin access post-deployment
- **Wrong database URL**: Authentication data loss
- **Missing migrations**: User/session tables not ready

### Security Oversights
- **HTTP instead of HTTPS**: Session hijacking risk
- **Weak session secret**: Session compromise
- **Mock auth in production**: Major security breach
- **Missing CSRF protection**: Cross-site attacks

## üìä Post-Deployment Monitoring

### Key Metrics to Watch (First 24 Hours)
- Authentication success rate > 95%
- Average login time < 3 seconds
- Session duration matches expectations
- No 401 errors for authenticated users
- Admin functions accessible to authorized users

### Alerts to Configure
- Auth success rate drops below 90%
- More than 10 consecutive auth failures
- Development user detected in production
- Session store errors
- OAuth provider errors

## üîß Quick Fixes for Common Issues

### OAuth Redirect URI Mismatch
```bash
# Check Replit OAuth app settings
# Ensure callback URL matches: https://your-domain.replit.app/api/callback
# Update domain in OAuth app if changed
```

### Session Store Issues
```sql
-- Check session table
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM sessions;

-- Clear old sessions if needed
DELETE FROM sessions WHERE expire < NOW();
```

### Missing Admin Access
```sql
-- Grant admin rights to user
UPDATE users SET is_admin = true WHERE email = 'admin@yourdomain.com';
```

## üìù Post-Deployment Documentation

### Required Updates After Each Deployment
- [ ] Update production URL in documentation
- [ ] Record any configuration changes
- [ ] Document any issues encountered and solutions
- [ ] Update monitoring dashboards
- [ ] Verify backup procedures are working

### Success Criteria
‚úÖ **All users can authenticate successfully**
‚úÖ **Admin panel is accessible to authorized users**
‚úÖ **No development artifacts in production**
‚úÖ **All API endpoints require proper authentication**
‚úÖ **Session management works correctly**
‚úÖ **Performance meets baseline expectations**
