| Payment Processing | ‚úÖ Complete | 90% | Production testing needed |
| Database Schema | ‚úÖ Complete | 90% | Production setup needed |
| Admin Dashboard | ‚úÖ Complete | 90% | Content population needed |
| Email System | ‚ùå Missing | 30% | Service integration required |
| Error Monitoring | ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial | 50% | Sentry completion needed |
| Content Management | ‚úÖ Complete | 85% | Production data needed |

## üöÄ SOFT LAUNCH STRATEGY

Given the current state, consider a **soft launch approach**:

1. **Phase 1: Core Launch** (Week 1-2)
   - Deploy with essential systems only
   - Manual email handling initially
   - Basic monitoring and logging
   - Limited user invitations

2. **Phase 2: Full Launch** (Week 3-4)
   - Complete email automation
   - Enhanced monitoring and alerts
   - Performance optimizations
   - Public announcement and marketing

This allows for revenue generation while completing remaining systems in parallel.

## üìù NOTES

- Most core systems are production-ready
- Email integration is the primary blocker
- Database and payment systems are robust
- Admin tools are comprehensive and functional
- Performance optimization can be done post-launch
- The system can handle real users once email is resolved

**Recommendation**: Focus on email integration first, then proceed with database setup and security hardening for a successful production launch.
