# Production Logging Review

**Date:** June 28, 2025
**For:** Claude Review

## Overview
The `/server/routes/index.ts` file contains multiple console.log statements that may be too verbose for production. This document outlines logging considerations.

## Current Logging Analysis

### Route Registration Logs
The following logs are currently in place:
- "üîß Setting up application routes..."
- "üìä Performance monitoring enabled"
- "‚úÖ [Auth Mode] authentication setup complete"
- "‚úÖ S3 client initialized"
- "üìù Registering core API routes..."
- Multiple "‚úÖ [Route Type] routes registered" messages
- "‚úÖ All routes registered successfully"

### Recommendations

1. **Environment-Based Logging**
   - In production, these logs should be at INFO level
   - Consider using a proper logger with log levels
   - Startup logs are useful but should be concise in production

2. **Structured Logging**
   - Replace console.log with a proper logger (Winston is already in use elsewhere)
   - Use structured logging for better parsing and monitoring

3. **Suggested Log Levels**
   - DEBUG: Individual route registration messages
   - INFO: Overall setup success/failure
   - ERROR: Any setup failures

## Implementation Suggestion

```typescript
import { logger } from '../utils/logger';

// In production:
logger.info('Application routes setup complete', {
  authMode: authResult.mode,
  s3Enabled: features.s3Enabled,
  analyticsEnabled: features.analyticsEnabled
});

// In development:
logger.debug('Registered core API routes');
```

## Next Steps
1. Import and use the existing logger from utils/logger.ts
2. Replace console.log statements with appropriate logger calls
3. Set log levels based on NODE_ENV
