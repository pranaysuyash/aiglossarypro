# Project Status Log - June 21, 2025

## ðŸ“‹ **Current Status**

This log marks the completion of fixing critical TypeScript errors in the `server/routes/analytics.ts` file and documents the plan for resolving the remaining issues.

### **Recent Commits**

1.  **Commit:** `ea74ff5`
    *   **Summary:** `ðŸ”§ Fix TypeScript errors in analytics routes`
    *   **Details:** Resolved 15 TypeScript errors by replacing calls to non-existent `storage` methods with direct `drizzle` ORM database queries. This fixed all analytics-related API endpoints.

2.  **Commit:** `feb5dfe`
    *   **Summary:** `ðŸ“‹ Create comprehensive TypeScript error resolution plan`
    *   **Details:** Created `docs/TYPESCRIPT_ERROR_RESOLUTION_PLAN.md` which documents the remaining 228 TypeScript errors and outlines a 4-phase strategy to resolve them.

### **Next Steps**

The immediate priority is to address the high-impact errors as outlined in the resolution plan, starting with:
1.  **Authentication & Express Type Issues:** Fixing `AuthenticatedRequest` type problems across multiple route files.
2.  **Missing Storage Methods:** Implementing or replacing other missing methods in the `storage.ts` layer.

The project is now in a stable state with the analytics features fully functional. The next phase of work will focus on achieving full TypeScript compliance.
