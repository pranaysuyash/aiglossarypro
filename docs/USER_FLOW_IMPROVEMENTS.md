# User Flow Improvements - January 12, 2025

## Overview
This document details the comprehensive user flow improvements implemented based on user feedback analysis.

**Benefits**:
- Reduces user frustration
- Encourages conversion through value demonstration
- Maintains engagement even after limits

```typescript
// Server-side highlighting
const highlightText = (text: string, query: string): string => {
  const regex = new RegExp(`(${query})`, 'gi');
  return text.replace(regex, '<mark>$1</mark>');
};

// Client-side safe rendering
const HighlightedText = ({ text }) => (
  <span dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: DOMPurify.sanitize(text) }} />
);
```
