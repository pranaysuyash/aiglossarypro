  return true;
}

if (variant === 'inline') {
  const content = getInlineContent();
  // Contextual prompts for sections, features, and limits
}
```

### 3. PPP Pricing Integration
```typescript
// client/src/pages/Lifetime.tsx
const pricing = useCountryPricing();
// Dynamic pricing: ${pricing.localPrice} with regional adjustments
```

### 4. Analytics Enhancement
```typescript
// client/src/types/analytics.ts
export const trackUpgradeClick = (source: string, tier: string = 'lifetime'): void => {
  trackEvent('upgrade_click', {
    event_category: 'upgrade',
    event_label: `${source}_to_${tier}`,
    value: 249,
  });
};
```

### 5. Google AdSense Configuration
