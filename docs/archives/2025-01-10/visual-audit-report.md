# Visual Audit Report - AI/ML Glossary

**Date:** June 29, 2025  
**Auditor:** Claude Code Assistant

## Executive Summary

The visual audit revealed several critical issues affecting user experience and accessibility. The most severe issues include a broken favorites page with error display, missing mobile navigation on tablet/mobile views, and a 404 error on the profile page. Additionally, there are consistency and spacing issues throughout the application.

## Critical Issues (Must Fix)

### 1. **Favorites Page - Critical Error Display**

  - Add proper null/undefined checks for data
  - Never display technical error details to end users

### 2. **Profile Page - 404 Not Found**
- **Severity:** CRITICAL
- **Page:** Profile
- **Issue:** Profile page returns 404 error despite being linked in navigation

### 3. **Mobile Navigation Missing**
- **Severity:** HIGH
- **Page:** Homepage (Mobile)
- **Issue:** No hamburger menu or navigation visible on mobile view
- **Impact:** Users cannot navigate the site on mobile devices

- **Page:** Homepage (Desktop)
- **Issues:**
  - Inconsistent card heights in featured terms section
  - Misaligned "Read more" links
  - Uneven spacing between sections
  - Categories sidebar cuts off with ellipsis
- **Recommendations:**
  - Use CSS Grid or Flexbox with equal heights

### 6. **Mobile Responsiveness**
- **Severity:** HIGH
- **Page:** Homepage (Tablet)
- **Issues:**
  - Content doesn't adapt well to tablet width
  - Cards remain in single column instead of utilizing space
  - Footer subscription form breaks layout
- **Recommendations:**
  - Implement tablet-specific breakpoints (768px)
  - Use 2-column grid for cards on tablets
  - Fix footer form responsiveness

## Medium Priority Issues

### 7. **Visual Hierarchy**
- **Severity:** MEDIUM
- **Issues:**
  - All text appears to have similar weight
  - Lack of clear visual separation between sections
  - Categories sidebar dominates visual space

### 9. **Progress Indicators**
- **Severity:** MEDIUM
- **Page:** Homepage
- **Issues:**
  - "Terms learned" and "Daily streak" show as raw numbers
  - No visual representation of progress
- **Recommendations:**
  - Add progress bars or circular progress indicators
  - Use more engaging visual representations
  - Add context (e.g., "0/362 terms learned")

## Low Priority Issues

### 10. **Footer Design**
- **Severity:** LOW
- **Issues:**
  - Footer feels disconnected from main content
  - Social links use generic icons
  - Copyright text is barely visible
- **Recommendations:**

### 11. **Empty States**
- **Severity:** LOW
- **Issues:**
  - "Recently Viewed" shows generic message
  - No illustrations or helpful CTAs
- **Recommendations:**
  - Add friendly illustrations for empty states
  - Include actionable CTAs (e.g., "Start exploring terms")
  - Make empty states more engaging

## Accessibility Concerns

1. **Missing ARIA labels** on interactive elements
2. **No skip navigation** links
3. **Poor keyboard navigation** indicators
4. **Missing alt text** on images
5. **Insufficient color contrast** in multiple areas

## Responsive Design Summary

   class ErrorBoundary extends React.Component {
     // Catch and display user-friendly errors
   }
   ```

2. **Create Responsive Navigation Component**
   ```tsx
   const ResponsiveNav = () => {
     // Mobile-first navigation with hamburger menu
   }
   ```

3. **Standardize Card Components**
   ```css
   .card {
     min-height: 200px;
     display: flex;
     flex-direction: column;

   ```

4. **Define CSS Variables for Consistency**
   ```css
   :root {
     --spacing-unit: 8px;
     --text-primary: #1a1a1a;
     --text-secondary: #666;
   }
   ```

## Conclusion

The application shows promise but requires significant improvements in error handling, mobile responsiveness, and visual consistency. Addressing the critical issues should be the immediate priority, followed by systematic improvements to the overall design system and user experience.
