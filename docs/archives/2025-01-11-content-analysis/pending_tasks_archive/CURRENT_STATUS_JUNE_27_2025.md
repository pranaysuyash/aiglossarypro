1. **server/routes/media.ts** - Critical security fixes
   - Replaced dangerous `sql.raw()` with parameterized queries
   - Added file magic number validation
   - Implemented path traversal protection
   - Added header injection prevention

2. **server/optimizedStorage.ts** - Missing method fix

// BEFORE (DANGEROUS):
await db.execute(sql`SELECT * FROM media_files ${sql.raw(whereClause)}`);

// AFTER (SECURE):
const conditions = [];
if (termId) conditions.push(sql`term_id = ${termId}`);
if (type) conditions.push(sql`mime_type LIKE ${`${type}/%`}`);
const whereClause = sql.join(conditions, sql` AND `);
```
