# Audit Findings

## 1. Environment Configuration Issue

**Issue:** The `BASE_URL` in the `.env` file was incorrectly set to `http://localhost:3001`, pointing to the backend server. This caused the visual audit script, which relies on this variable, to fail because it was trying to run visual tests against the API server instead of the frontend UI server.

**File:** `AIGlossaryPro/.env`

**Incorrect Configuration:**
```
BASE_URL=http://localhost:3001
```

**Resolution:** The issue was resolved by overriding the `BASE_URL` environment variable directly in the command line when running the audit script. This is a safer approach than modifying the `.env` file directly, as it scopes the change to the specific command being executed.

**Corrected Command:**
```bash
BASE_URL=http://localhost:5173 npm run audit:visual:comprehensive
```

**Recommendation:** For a long-term fix, consider creating a separate `.env.test` file for test-specific environment variables. The testing scripts could then be configured to use this file, isolating the test environment from the development and production environments.

## 2. Visual Audit Findings

**Report Location:** `AIGlossaryPro/comprehensive-audit/2025-07-10T12-07-48-954Z/index.html`

### 2.1. Critical Issues

*   **Page Load Error:** The audit reported a critical error for the `error-states` test. The test, which attempts to navigate to a non-existent page to verify the 404 error handling, failed to load. This could indicate a problem with the application's routing or the server's ability to handle and render error pages.

### 2.2. Missing Interactive Elements

*   **Numerous Warnings:** The test execution log produced a large number of warnings indicating that many interactive elements (buttons, links, etc.) could not be found on the page. This is a significant issue that suggests a disconnect between the test scripts and the current state of the application's UI. The warnings include:
    *   `button[aria-label*="menu"]` (Mobile menu button)
    *   `.category-card:first-child`
    *   `.dashboard-card:first-child`
    *   `button[aria-label*="mode"]` (Dark mode toggle)
    *   And many others related to specific features like term cards, diagrams, quizzes, and accordions.

**Possible Causes:**
*   **Outdated Selectors:** The CSS selectors in the audit script may be outdated and no longer match the application's current HTML structure.
*   **UI Changes:** The application's UI may have been updated, and the test scripts have not been updated to reflect these changes.
*   **Timing Issues:** The script might be attempting to find elements before they are rendered on the page. This is common in applications with asynchronous data loading.

**Recommendation:** A thorough review of the selectors in `comprehensive-visual-audit.ts` is required. The selectors need to be updated to match the current UI. Additionally, the script should be reviewed for potential timing issues, and `waitForSelector` calls with appropriate timeouts should be used to ensure elements are present before interacting with them.

## 3. Functional Audit Findings

**Report Location:** `AIGlossaryPro/functional-audit/2025-07-10T12-24-25-877Z/index.html`

### 3.1. Critical Failures

*   **Authentication Flow:** The authentication process is fundamentally broken for all user types (free, premium, and admin). The script fails to detect a successful login, with the error `Unknown engine "text*" while parsing selector text*=Welcome, text*=welcome, .toast, .notification`. This indicates a problem with the Playwright selectors used to verify a successful login.
*   **Responsive Design:** The tests for responsive design failed. The mobile menu button was not found, and multiple navigation elements were detected, which violates Playwright's strict mode. This suggests that the navigation structure has changed and the test scripts are no longer valid.

### 3.2. Warnings

*   **Test User Population:** The tests for premium and admin users are failing to populate the login credentials correctly. This is a critical issue that prevents any further testing of these user roles.

### 3.3. Recommendations

*   **Fix Authentication Selectors:** The Playwright selectors in `comprehensive-functional-audit.ts` for verifying login success must be updated to match the current application. The `text*=` selector is not valid and should be replaced with a valid Playwright selector.
*   **Update Responsive Design Tests:** The responsive design tests need to be updated to reflect the current navigation structure. The selectors for the mobile menu and navigation elements must be corrected.
*   **Debug Test User Population:** The logic for populating test user credentials needs to be investigated and fixed.
