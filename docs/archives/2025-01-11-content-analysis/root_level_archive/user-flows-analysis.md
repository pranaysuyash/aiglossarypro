# User Flows Analysis Request

## Current User Flows for AI/ML Glossary Pro

### 1. Unauthenticated Visitors (Public Preview)
- **Entry Point**: Marketing landing page or main app
- **Access**: Can browse high-level content (term titles, categories, search results)
- **Limitation**: Full term definitions are gated behind login
- **Behavior**: API returns 401 Unauthorized for term details
- **Conversion**: Must create account via OAuth (Google/GitHub) before accessing definitions
- **Design Goal**: Capture sign-ups before providing value for tracking and upsells
- **Current Issue**: High friction - no actual glossary content visible without login

### 2. Free Tier Users (Registered, Ad-Supported)
- **Access**: Can search entire glossary (~10k term entries) and view definitions
- **Daily View Limit**: 50 term views per 24-hour period
- **Monetization**: Ads displayed (Google AdSense integration in progress)
- **Feature Access**: Core glossary content available, premium features reserved for Pro
- **Limitation Handling**: HTTP 429 error when limit reached
- **Upgrade Prompts**: CTAs in header, pop-ups after certain view counts

### Current Implementation Issues
1. **Logic Quirk**: 7-day grace period for new users not working - limit applies from day one
2. **Error Handling**: Daily limit results in HTTP 429 with unfriendly error message
3. **UI/UX**: Need friendly modal/prompt for upgrade instead of error page
4. **Ad Integration**: Google AdSense integration still in progress

## Specific Questions
