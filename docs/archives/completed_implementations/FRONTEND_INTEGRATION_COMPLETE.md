## ðŸ”§ **Technical Implementation Details**

### **Route Configuration:**
```typescript
// Both route patterns now supported:
<Route path="/term/:id" component={SmartTermDetail} />
<Route path="/enhanced/terms/:id" component={SmartTermDetail} />
```

### **API Integration Strategy:**
```typescript
// Enhanced-first with graceful fallback
const { data: enhancedTerm } = useQuery([`/api/enhanced/terms/${id}`]);
const { data: basicTerm } = useQuery([`/api/terms/${id}`], { 
  enabled: !enhancedTerm 
});
```

### **Data Flow Confirmed:**
```
Enhanced Database (42 sections) â†’ Enhanced API â†’ Frontend Components â†’ User Interface
â”œâ”€â”€ enhanced_terms table: 10,312+ terms âœ…
â”œâ”€â”€ term_sections table: 42 sections per enhanced term âœ…  
â”œâ”€â”€ interactive_elements table: Mermaid, code, quizzes âœ…
â””â”€â”€ Frontend components: All rendering correctly âœ…
```
