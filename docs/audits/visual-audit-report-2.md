## Audit Scope
This visual audit focuses on validating the technical findings from the codebase analysis:

### Key Issues to Validate:
1. **Hero Section Button**: "See What's Inside" button color and prominence
2. **Header Buttons**: "Get Access" vs "Sign In" consistency
3. **Money-Back Guarantee**: Presence and visibility of "30-day money back guarantee" text
4. **Visual Hierarchy**: Overall design consistency and button styling
5. **Color Consistency**: Button colors across different sections

## Technical Findings to Validate:

### Button Styling Issues:
- Hero button uses light gray background (#f3f4f6)
- Should use primary blue (#10B981 or #3B82F6)
- Header shows both "Get Access" and "Sign In" buttons

### Missing Elements:
- No "30-day money back guarantee" text found in codebase
- Trust indicators may be missing

### Visual Hierarchy:
- Hero button may not stand out sufficiently
- Call-to-action prominence needs evaluation

## Next Steps:
1. Review screenshots for visual confirmation of issues
2. Compare actual rendering with code analysis
3. Document any additional issues found
4. Prioritize fixes based on visual impact
