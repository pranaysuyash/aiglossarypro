# Consolidated Pending TODOs - January 13, 2025

**Status**: Active Development Tasks  
**Priority**: Medium to High based on impact  
**Created**: January 13, 2025 by TODO Archival and Consolidation Agent  

## Overview

After comprehensive validation and archival of completed TODOs, this document consolidates all genuinely pending development work. The project is 85-90% complete with high-quality implementations already in place.

## ðŸŽ¯ HIGH PRIORITY PENDING WORK

### 1. Type Safety Refactoring (Medium Priority)
**Source**: TECHNICAL_DEBT_RESOLUTION_TODOS.md  
**Status**: Active - Significant technical debt identified  
**Files Affected**: 340 files with TypeScript 'any' usage  

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Replace 'any' types with proper type definitions
- [ ] Add type guards for dynamic data
- [ ] Improve component prop typing
- [ ] Add proper error type definitions

**Impact**: Code maintainability and developer experience  
**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 weeks (gradual refactoring)  

### 2. Mathematical Notation Enhancement (Medium Priority)
**Source**: CONTENT_COMPONENTS_IMPLEMENTATION_TODOS.md  
**Status**: Enhancement opportunity  

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Integrate KaTeX for mathematical expressions
- [ ] Add LaTeX support for complex formulas
- [ ] Implement equation rendering in term definitions
- [ ] Add mathematical notation to search functionality

**Files to Modify**:
- `client/src/components/term/TermContentRenderer.tsx`
- `client/src/components/search/SearchResults.tsx`
- `package.json` (add KaTeX dependency)

**Estimated Effort**: 1-2 weeks  

### 3. Incremental Processing System (Optional Scalability)
**Source**: INCREMENTAL_PROCESSING_TODOS.md  
**Status**: Performance optimization for large files  

**Purpose**: Handle 10,000+ term imports without timeouts  
**Current Status**: Works for normal operations, optimization for edge cases  

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Implement chunked processing for large Excel imports
- [ ] Add progress tracking for long operations
- [ ] Implement change detection to avoid reprocessing
- [ ] Add processing queue management

**Impact**: Scalability for very large content updates  
**Estimated Effort**: 1-2 weeks  

## ðŸ”„ MEDIUM PRIORITY ENHANCEMENTS

### 4. Community Features (Future Enhancement)
**Source**: NEW_FEATURE_IMPLEMENTATIONS_TODOS.md (archived - remaining items)  

**Genuinely Missing Features**:
- [ ] Community contribution system for user-generated content
- [ ] External resource curation (ArXiv/Scholar API integrations)
- [ ] Advanced analytics engine with ML-powered recommendations

**Status**: Enhancement phase, not critical for launch  
**Estimated Effort**: 4-6 weeks for complete implementation  

### 5. Performance Monitoring Enhancements
**Source**: Various performance optimization documents  

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Add more granular performance metrics
- [ ] Implement user experience monitoring
- [ ] Add automated performance regression testing
- [ ] Enhance caching strategies for edge cases

**Impact**: User experience optimization  
**Estimated Effort**: 1-2 weeks
