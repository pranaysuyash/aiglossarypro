## 🔴 Outdated/Inaccurate Proposals

The following suggestions were found to be **already implemented** or **incorrect**:

1. **"Grace period logic is inverted"** - ❌ Works correctly in codebase
2. **"No AdSense script yet"** - ❌ Fully implemented with lazy loading  
3. **"Just responds with error JSON"** - ❌ Has sophisticated UI handling
4. **"No 401 interceptors"** - ❌ Proper error handling exists
5. **"Purchase flow needs improvement"** - ❌ Already professional-grade

## Implementation Status
