## Key Findings

1. **Documentation Lag**: Many TODOs were severely outdated, claiming features as missing when they were fully implemented
2. **Implementation Quality**: Actual implementations exceeded expected quality standards
3. **Project Status**: 85-90% complete vs previously estimated 60-70%
4. **Technical Debt**: Less severe than documented, mostly type safety improvements needed

## Next Steps

Remaining active TODOs focus on:
- Type safety improvements (800+ 'any' instances)
- Feedback system placeholder replacement
- Incremental processing for large files (optional scalability enhancement)
- Mathematical notation enhancement (KaTeX/MathJax integration)
