# Landing Page Visual Audit Analysis

Please analyze the landing page screenshots and check for the specific issues we've been working on.

## Key Areas to Check

### 1. Footer Duplication (FIXED)
- **Check**: Look at the bottom of the full-page screenshots
- **Expected**: Only ONE footer should be visible (the landing page footer with newsletter signup)
- **Issue**: Previously had both main app footer AND landing page footer

### 2. Header Button Spacing & Positioning  
- **Check**: Header area in desktop and mobile views
- **Expected**: Proper spacing between "Sign In" and "Get Lifetime Access" buttons
- **Issue**: Buttons were cramped/overlapping

### 3. "See What's Inside" Button Visibility
- **Check**: Hero section for the main CTA button
- **Expected**: Button should be clearly visible with proper contrast
- **Issue**: Was white text on transparent background (invisible)

### 4. Mobile Header CTA
- **Check**: Mobile view header
- **Expected**: Should have mobile-specific CTA button
- **Issue**: Mobile users couldn't easily access primary action

### 5. Scroll Navigation (Pricing/FAQ)
- **Check**: Can you navigate to pricing and FAQ sections?
- **Expected**: Smooth scroll behavior when clicking navigation links
- **Issue**: Clicking Pricing/FAQ didn't scroll to sections

### 6. Newsletter Footer Integration
- **Check**: Bottom footer area
- **Expected**: Clean newsletter signup form with proper styling
- **Issue**: Should be the only footer visible
