- **Mobile Optimization**: Better performance on mobile devices

### 3. ‚úÖ Production Logging & Error Monitoring

#### **Winston Logging System**
Comprehensive structured logging with file rotation and component-specific loggers.

```typescript
// server/utils/logger.ts - Production logging
- Structured JSON logging with timestamps
- Rotating file system (5MB files, 5 file retention)
- Component-specific loggers (API, auth, database, security)
- Performance monitoring and health check logging
- Development vs production configuration
```

#### **Sentry Error Monitoring**
Full-stack error tracking with performance monitoring and user context.

```typescript
// server/utils/sentry.ts + client/src/utils/sentry.ts
- Server-side error tracking with performance monitoring
- Frontend error boundaries and user action tracking
- Security-aware data filtering (passwords, tokens filtered)
- Performance transaction tracking
- User context management with privacy protection
```

#### **Comprehensive Middleware**
Request tracking, security monitoring, and performance analysis.

```typescript
// server/middleware/loggingMiddleware.ts
- Request/response logging with unique request IDs
- Security event detection and suspicious pattern monitoring
- Rate limit logging and violation tracking
- Performance tracking for slow request identification
- User context extraction and breadcrumb management
```

### 4. ‚úÖ System Integration & Documentation

#### **Server Integration**
Updated main server file to integrate all monitoring systems:
- Sentry initialization at startup
- Comprehensive middleware stack
- Error handling integration
- Performance monitoring activation

#### **Documentation Updates**
- Updated `CLAUDE.md` with 95% completion status
- Added performance breakthrough documentation
- Documented new monitoring capabilities
- Updated architecture description
