# Storage Architecture Migration - Detailed Implementation Task List

**Document Type:** Implementation Planning & Task Breakdown  
**Created:** January 2025  
**Status:** Planning Phase - Awaiting Gemini Review  
**Priority:** Critical - Foundation for all future development  

---

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the detailed implementation plan for migrating to a unified storage architecture based on the agreed strategy: **All routes use enhancedStorage for complete 42-section data access**. The plan is structured in phases with specific tasks, questions for Gemini review, and decision points.

---

## Implementation Strategy Overview

### **Agreed Architecture:**
- **Single Public Interface:** `enhancedStorage` for all routes
- **Internal Composition:** `enhancedStorage` uses `optimizedStorage` internally
- **Complete Data Access:** All 295-column → 42-section data available
- **Performance Maintained:** Through internal optimization and opt-in loading

### **Migration Timeline:**
- **Phase 1:** Immediate fixes (1-2 days)
- **Phase 2:** enhancedStorage consolidation (3-4 days)  
- **Phase 3:** Route migration (5-7 days)
- **Phase 4:** Cleanup and testing (2-3 days)
- **Future:** S3 pipeline and content governance (separate phases)

---

## Phase 1: Immediate TypeScript Fixes (1-2 Days)

### **Objective:** Stop bleeding - fix critical compilation errors blocking development

### **Task 1.1: Fix enhancedRoutes.ts storage references**
- **Status:** ✅ COMPLETED
- **Action:** Replaced all `storage` with `enhancedStorage` in enhancedRoutes.ts
- **Files:** `server/enhancedRoutes.ts`

### **Task 1.2: Fix duplicate db imports**
- **Status:** ✅ COMPLETED  
- **Action:** Removed duplicate db import lines in enhancedStorage.ts
- **Files:** `server/enhancedStorage.ts`

### **Task 1.3: Fix missing db imports**
- **Current Status:** PENDING
- **Action Required:** Add `import { db } from './db';` to files missing it
- **Files to Fix:** 
  - Any files with "Cannot find name 'db'" errors
- **Question for Gemini:** Should we standardize on direct db imports or always go through storage layers?
    *   **Gemini's Comment:** For consistency and encapsulation, **all database interactions should ideally go through the storage layers (`enhancedStorage` or its internal dependencies like `optimizedStorage`)**. Direct `db` imports in route files or other business logic should be avoided. This centralizes data access logic, making it easier to manage caching, logging, and future changes. So, the action should be to refactor code to use existing storage methods, or add new methods to `enhancedStorage` if needed, rather than adding direct `db` imports.

### **Task 1.4: Fix middleware callback issues**
- **Current Status:** PENDING
- **Error Pattern:** `Expected 3-4 arguments, but got 1` in analyticsMiddleware and loggingMiddleware
- **Files:** 
  - `server/middleware/analyticsMiddleware.ts`
  - `server/middleware/loggingMiddleware.ts`
- **Question for Gemini:** Should we fix these immediately or defer to Phase 2?
    *   **Gemini's Comment:** **Fix these immediately in Phase 1.** Middleware issues can affect the entire request pipeline and are often critical for application functionality (e.g., analytics, logging). They are foundational and should be resolved before proceeding with larger architectural changes.

### **Task 1.5: Fix AuthenticatedRequest type issues**
- **Current Status:** PENDING
- **Error Pattern:** Type incompatibility between Request and AuthenticatedRequest
- **Files:** Multiple route files using AuthenticatedRequest
- **Question for Gemini:** Is this blocking or can we address in Phase 2?
    *   **Gemini's Comment:** If these are *blocking* compilation or runtime, **fix them in Phase 1**. If they are non-blocking type warnings that don't prevent the application from running, they can be deferred to **Phase 2** as part of general type system hardening and interface definition. Prioritize based on immediate impact on development flow.

---

## Phase 2: enhancedStorage Consolidation (3-4 Days)

### **Objective:** Make enhancedStorage the complete, unified storage interface

### **Task 2.1: Method Audit and Gap Analysis**
- **Current Status:** PLANNING
- **Action Required:**
  1. List all methods currently in `optimizedStorage.ts`
  2. List all methods currently in `storage.ts`  
  3. List all methods currently in `enhancedStorage.ts`
  4. Identify gaps where routes need methods not in enhancedStorage
- **Question for Gemini:** Should we maintain strict interface compatibility or can we refactor method signatures for better clarity?
    *   **Gemini's Comment:** **Prioritize clarity and correctness over strict backward compatibility for internal interfaces.** Since `enhancedStorage` will be the single public interface for routes, its methods should be clear, semantically correct, and reflect the data it provides (including enhanced features). If refactoring a method signature improves its clarity or aligns it better with the new architecture, do so. However, ensure that the migration of calling code (in Phase 3) accounts for these changes. For the `IStorage` interface that `optimizedStorage` implements, it should remain compatible with its current usage.

### **Task 2.2: Add Missing Core Methods to enhancedStorage**
- **Current Status:** PLANNING
- **Known Missing Methods (from TypeScript errors):**
  - `getAdminStats()` 
  - `clearAllData()`
  - `getTermCount()`
  - `reindexDatabase()`
  - `cleanupDatabase()`
  - `vacuumDatabase()`
  - `getAllUsers()`
  - `getPendingContent()`
  - `approveContent()`
  - `rejectContent()`
  - And ~50+ others based on error output

- **Implementation Options:**
  1. **Direct Implementation:** Add methods directly to enhancedStorage class
  2. **Delegation Pattern:** Have enhancedStorage call optimizedStorage methods
  3. **Hybrid Approach:** Direct for enhanced features, delegation for basic operations

- **Question for Gemini:** Which implementation pattern should we use for each type of method?
    *   **Gemini's Comment:** The **Hybrid Approach (Option 3)** is the most appropriate and aligns with the revised architectural recommendations.
        *   **Delegation Pattern:** For methods that are already well-implemented and optimized in `optimizedStorage.ts` (e.g., basic CRUD, user management, simple analytics that don't involve 42-section data), `enhancedStorage.ts` should **delegate** these calls directly to its internal `optimizedStorage` instance. This leverages existing performance work and avoids code duplication.
        *   **Direct Implementation (or Orchestration):** For methods that specifically deal with the 42-section data, interactive elements, or other advanced features, `enhancedStorage.ts` should implement these directly. This might involve orchestrating calls to `optimizedStorage` for basic data and then enriching it with section-specific queries.
        *   **Example:** `enhancedStorage.getTermById(id)` might call `optimizedStorage.getTermById(id)` for basic term data, and then, if `includeSections` is true, perform additional queries to retrieve and attach the 42-section data.

### **Task 2.3: Implement Opt-in Data Loading**
- **Current Status:** PLANNING
- **Concept:** Methods support basic vs enhanced data loading
- **Example:**
  ```typescript
  // Basic term data (fast)
  async getTermById(id: string): Promise<BasicTerm>
  
  // Full 42-section data (comprehensive)
  async getTermById(id: string, options: { includeSections: true }): Promise<EnhancedTerm>
  ```

- **Methods to Enhance:**
  - `getTermById()`
  - `searchTerms()`
  - `getTermsByCategory()`
  - `getAllTerms()`

- **Questions for Gemini:**
  1. Should we use method overloading or options parameter?
  2. What should be the default behavior - basic or enhanced data?
  3. How granular should the options be (e.g., specific sections)?
    *   **Gemini's Comment:**
        1.  **Options Parameter:** Use an **options parameter** for methods that can return both basic and enhanced data. This is generally more flexible and extensible than method overloading, especially in TypeScript where optional properties in an interface can clearly define the different data retrieval needs.
            ```typescript
            interface GetTermOptions {
                includeSections?: boolean;
                includeRelatedTerms?: boolean;
                // ... other options for specific data
            }

            async getTermById(id: string, options?: GetTermOptions): Promise<Term | EnhancedTerm> {
                // ... logic to load basic term
                if (options?.includeSections) {
                    // ... load and attach sections
                }
                // ...
            }
            ```
        2.  **Default Behavior:** The **default behavior should be basic data** (i.e., without sections) for performance reasons. Routes that explicitly need the 42-section data will pass the `includeSections: true` option.
        3.  **Granularity:** Start with a simple `includeSections: boolean`. If future requirements demand it, you can expand the options to be more granular (e.g., `includeSections: string[]` to specify particular section names, or `includeInteractiveElements: boolean`). Avoid over-engineering granularity initially.

### **Task 2.4: Performance Optimization Strategy**
- **Current Status:** PLANNING
- **Optimization Areas:**
  1. **Caching Strategy:** How to cache 42-section data efficiently
  2. **Lazy Loading:** When to load sections vs basic data
  3. **Query Optimization:** Efficient joins for section data
  4. **Memory Management:** Preventing memory bloat with large section data

- **Questions for Gemini:**
  1. Should we implement section-level caching or term-level caching?
  2. What's the acceptable memory footprint for cached enhanced data?
  3. Should we implement automatic cache warming for popular terms?
    *   **Gemini's Comment:**
        1.  **Caching Strategy:** Implement **term-level caching for basic term data** (as `optimizedStorage` likely already does). For 42-section data, consider **section-level caching** if sections are often accessed independently or if a term's sections are updated individually. However, if sections are almost always retrieved as a complete set for a term, then caching the entire `EnhancedTerm` object (including all its sections) at the **term-level** might be simpler and more efficient. The key is to invalidate the cache effectively when any part of the term or its sections changes.
        2.  **Acceptable Memory Footprint:** This is highly dependent on your server resources and expected traffic. A general guideline is to monitor memory usage closely during load testing. Aim to keep it well within available RAM to avoid swapping. Start with a reasonable cache size (e.g., a few hundred or thousand terms) and monitor. If memory becomes an issue, consider external caching solutions (like Redis, as Claude mentioned) or more aggressive eviction policies.
        3.  **Cache Warming:** **Yes, implement automatic cache warming for popular terms.** This is a great idea for performance. You can identify popular terms based on view counts or analytics and periodically pre-populate their enhanced data into the cache. This ensures that frequently accessed content is always served quickly.

### **Task 2.5: Create Unified Interface Definition**
- **Current Status:** PLANNING
- **Action Required:** Define TypeScript interface that enhancedStorage will implement
- **Interface Scope:**
  - All current IStorage methods
  - All enhanced-specific methods
  - New opt-in loading methods

- **Question for Gemini:** Should we maintain backward compatibility with existing IStorage interface or create a new IEnhancedStorage interface?
    *   **Gemini's Comment:** **Create a new `IEnhancedStorage` interface.** This clearly signals the expanded capabilities and avoids potential confusion or accidental misuse of the older, less capable `IStorage` interface. `enhancedStorage` will implement `IEnhancedStorage`. You can then ensure that `IEnhancedStorage` *includes* all the method signatures from `IStorage` (or a refined version of it) to ensure all necessary methods are present. This provides a clean break and a clear contract for the new unified storage layer.

## Phase 3: Route Migration (5-7 Days)

### **Objective:** Migrate all routes to use enhancedStorage uniformly

### **Task 3.1: Route Migration Priority Assessment**
- **Current Status:** PLANNING
- **Routes to Migrate (in priority order):**

#### **High Priority (Core functionality):**
1. `server/routes/terms.ts` - Term retrieval and search
2. `server/routes/content.ts` - Content management
3. `server/routes/categories.ts` - Category operations
4. `server/routes/search.ts` - Search functionality

#### **Medium Priority (Admin functionality):**
5. `server/routes/admin.ts` - Admin operations
6. `server/routes/admin/content.ts` - Content admin
7. `server/routes/admin/revenue.ts` - Revenue management
8. `server/routes/admin/users.ts` - User management

#### **Lower Priority (Supporting functionality):**
9. `server/routes/auth.ts` - Authentication
10. `server/routes/user.ts` - User profiles
11. `server/routes/sections.ts` - Section management
12. `server/routes/gumroad.ts` - Payment processing

- **Question for Gemini:** Does this prioritization make sense? Any routes we should prioritize differently?
    *   **Gemini's Comment:** This prioritization makes good sense. Focusing on core user-facing functionality first (`terms`, `content`, `categories`, `search`) is critical, as these are the routes that will most directly benefit from the enhanced data and where the impact of the current issues is highest. Admin and supporting functionalities can follow.

### **Task 3.2: Migration Pattern Definition**
- **Current Status:** PLANNING
- **Standard Migration Pattern:**
  ```typescript
  // Before:
  import { optimizedStorage as storage } from "./optimizedStorage";
  
  // After:
  import { enhancedStorage as storage } from "./enhancedStorage";
  ```

- **Testing Strategy for Each Route:**
  1. Update import statement
  2. Run TypeScript compilation check
  3. Test basic functionality
  4. Test enhanced functionality (if applicable)
  5. Performance verification

- **Question for Gemini:** Should we migrate routes one-by-one with testing, or batch them by functionality?
    *   **Gemini's Comment:** **Migrate routes one-by-one or in very small, tightly related batches, with thorough testing after each change.** This incremental approach significantly reduces risk, makes debugging easier, and allows for quick rollback if issues arise. The testing strategy you outlined is excellent and should be strictly followed for each migrated route.

### **Task 3.3: Handle Method Signature Changes**
- **Current Status:** PLANNING
- **Potential Issues:**
  - Methods with different parameter signatures
  - Methods returning different data structures
  - Async/sync behavior differences

- **Mitigation Strategy:**
  1. Document all signature differences
  2. Create adapter methods if needed
  3. Update calling code to match new signatures

- **Question for Gemini:** How strict should we be about maintaining exact compatibility vs improving the API?
    *   **Gemini's Comment:** **Prioritize improving the API of `enhancedStorage` for clarity and future extensibility.** While you should aim for a smooth migration, if a method signature in `optimizedStorage` or `storage` is suboptimal, this is the opportunity to improve it in `enhancedStorage`. The migration of calling code in Phase 3 is where you handle these changes. Documenting differences and creating adapter methods (if the change is significant and affects many call sites) are good mitigation strategies.

### **Task 3.4: Enhanced Data Integration**
- **Current Status:** PLANNING
- **Routes that should immediately use enhanced features:**
  - `terms.ts` - Return 42-section data when requested
  - `content.ts` - Support section-level operations
  - `search.ts` - Search within section content

- **Implementation Questions:**
  1. Should enhanced data be opt-in via query parameters?
  2. Should we automatically detect when enhanced data is needed?
  3. How do we handle API versioning for enhanced vs basic responses?

- **Question for Gemini:** What's your preferred approach for API clients to request enhanced data?
    *   **Gemini's Comment:**
        1.  **Opt-in via Query Parameters:** This is the most common and flexible approach for RESTful APIs. For example, `/api/terms/:id?includeSections=true`. This allows clients to explicitly request the richer data when they need it, avoiding unnecessary payload for simpler use cases.
        2.  **Automatic Detection:** Avoid automatic detection at the API level. Explicit requests are clearer and prevent unexpected performance impacts. The logic for "when enhanced data is needed" should reside in the client application, which then makes the appropriate API call.
        3.  **API Versioning:** For distinguishing enhanced vs. basic responses, consider:
            *   **Content Negotiation (Accept header):** Clients could request a specific media type (e.g., `Accept: application/vnd.glossary.enhanced+json`). This is RESTful but can be complex to implement.
            *   **Query Parameters (as above):** Simple and effective for controlling data granularity.
            *   **Separate Endpoints:** For very distinct data models, separate endpoints (e.g., `/api/terms/:id` for basic, `/api/terms/:id/enhanced` for full) can be considered, but this might lead to endpoint proliferation.
            *   **Recommendation:** Start with **query parameters** for opt-in data loading. If the data models diverge significantly in the future, then consider API versioning (e.g., `/v2/terms/:id`) or content negotiation.

## Phase 4: Cleanup and Testing (2-3 Days)

### **Objective:** Remove legacy code and ensure system stability

### **Task 4.1: Legacy Storage Cleanup**
- **Current Status:** PLANNING
- **Actions:**
  1. Remove `storage.ts` entirely (after confirming no dependencies)
  2. Make `optimizedStorage.ts` internal-only (remove from route imports)
  3. Update all documentation to reference enhancedStorage

- **Question for Gemini:** Should we keep storage.ts around temporarily as a backup, or remove it completely?
    *   **Gemini's Comment:** **Remove `storage.ts` completely** once all dependencies are migrated and tests pass. Keeping dead code around adds confusion and technical debt. Your version control system (Git) serves as the backup.

### **Task 4.2: Comprehensive Testing**
- **Current Status:** PLANNING
- **Testing Categories:**
  1. **Unit Tests:** Test enhancedStorage methods individually
  2. **Integration Tests:** Test route functionality end-to-end
  3. **Performance Tests:** Verify enhanced data loading performance
  4. **Data Integrity Tests:** Ensure 42-section data is correctly retrieved

- **Specific Test Cases:**
  - Basic term retrieval (should be fast)
  - Enhanced term retrieval (should include all sections)
  - Search functionality (basic vs enhanced results)
  - Admin operations (all existing functionality preserved)

- **Question for Gemini:** What level of test coverage should we aim for? Are there specific scenarios you're concerned about?
    *   **Gemini's Comment:**
        *   **Test Coverage:** Aim for **high test coverage (e.g., 80%+ line coverage)** for the `enhancedStorage.ts` module and critical routes. More importantly, focus on **scenario coverage**: ensure all major use cases (basic reads, enhanced reads, search, admin operations, edge cases like missing data, invalid IDs) are covered by integration and unit tests.
        *   **Specific Scenarios of Concern:**
            *   **Performance Degradation:** Ensure that adding the 42-section logic doesn't significantly slow down basic term retrieval or search operations that don't request sections.
            *   **Data Consistency:** Verify that the 42-section data retrieved matches the expected structure and content from the Excel parsing.
            *   **Partial Data:** Test scenarios where some sections might be missing or malformed, and how `enhancedStorage` handles this (e.g., does it return partial data or throw an error?).
            *   **Concurrency:** How does the caching and data loading behave under high concurrent requests?
            *   **Cache Invalidation:** Crucial for correctness. Ensure that updates to terms or sections correctly invalidate relevant cache entries.

### **Task 4.3: Performance Validation**
- **Current Status:** PLANNING
- **Benchmarks to Establish:**
  - Basic term retrieval latency (target: <100ms)
  - Enhanced term retrieval latency (target: <500ms)
  - Search response time (target: <1s)
  - Memory usage under load (target: <2GB)

- **Question for Gemini:** Are these performance targets realistic? What should we prioritize if we have to trade off?
    *   **Gemini's Comment:** These performance targets seem **reasonable as initial goals**.
        *   `<100ms` for basic retrieval is good.
        *   `<500ms` for enhanced retrieval is acceptable, especially if it involves multiple joins or data aggregation.
        *   `<1s` for search is also a good target, but may vary depending on search complexity and dataset size.
        *   `<2GB` memory usage is a good starting point, but monitor closely.
        *   **Prioritization in Trade-offs:** If trade-offs are necessary:
            1.  **Correctness and Data Integrity:** Never compromise on these.
            2.  **Basic Read Latency:** Keep basic term retrieval and common operations as fast as possible, as these will be the most frequent.
            3.  **Memory Usage:** Control memory to prevent application crashes or excessive hosting costs.
            4.  **Enhanced Read Latency:** Optimize as much as possible, but it's acceptable for complex queries to be slightly slower than basic ones.

### **Task 4.4: Documentation Updates**
- **Current Status:** PLANNING
- **Documentation to Update:**
  1. API documentation for enhanced features
  2. Developer guidelines for using enhancedStorage
  3. Architecture documentation
  4. Deployment and configuration guides

- **Question for Gemini:** Should we create examples showing how to use the new enhanced features?
    *   **Gemini's Comment:** **Absolutely, yes.** Clear code examples demonstrating how to request and consume enhanced data (e.g., using the `includeSections` option) are invaluable for developers and will significantly ease adoption and prevent misuse.

---

## Future Phases (Separate Planning)

### **Phase 5: S3-Based Data Pipeline (Future)**
- **Scope:** Row-by-row parsing → S3 storage → Event-driven ingestion
- **Timeline:** After storage migration is stable
- **Status:** Concept approved, detailed planning needed
    *   **Gemini's Comment:** This is a strong strategic direction (as **you, the user, suggested**). It decouples the parsing process and provides a robust data lake. Claude's points about increased complexity and data consistency challenges are valid, but the long-term benefits for scalability and flexibility outweigh them for a growing system. This phase should be planned in detail once the current storage architecture is stable.

### **Phase 6: Content Governance System (Future)**
- **Scope:** Monthly reviews, AI-assisted flagging, version control
- **Timeline:** After data pipeline is established
- **Status:** Strategy defined, implementation planning needed
    *   **Gemini's Comment:** This is another critical area (also **suggested by you, the user**). Maintaining content quality and relevance is paramount for a glossary. The integration of AI for flagging and suggestions is particularly promising. This phase should also be detailed once the underlying data architecture is solid.

## Technical Questions for Gemini Review

### **Architecture Decisions:**

1. **Method Implementation Pattern:**
   - Should enhancedStorage implement methods directly or delegate to optimizedStorage?
   - What's the preferred pattern for methods that need enhanced data vs basic data?
     *   **Gemini's Answer:** As discussed in Task 2.2, use a **Hybrid Approach**. Delegate basic operations to `optimizedStorage` and implement (or orchestrate) enhanced features directly within `enhancedStorage`. For methods that can return both, use an **options parameter** (e.g., `includeSections: boolean`) to control data loading.

2. **Interface Design:**
   - Maintain IStorage compatibility or create new IEnhancedStorage?
   - How should we handle method overloading for opt-in enhanced features?
     *   **Gemini's Answer:** **Create a new `IEnhancedStorage` interface** that `enhancedStorage` will implement. This interface should encompass all methods, including those for opt-in enhanced features. Use **options parameters** instead of method overloading for opt-in features.

3. **Performance Strategy:**
   - What caching strategy should we implement for 42-section data?
   - How should we balance memory usage vs response time?
     *   **Gemini's Answer:** Consider **term-level caching for full `EnhancedTerm` objects** if sections are usually accessed together, or **section-level caching** if they are accessed independently. Balance memory by monitoring usage and implementing appropriate cache eviction policies. Prioritize basic read latency and memory control. Implement **cache warming** for popular terms.

4. **Error Handling:**
   - How should we handle cases where section data is missing or corrupted?
   - What's the fallback strategy if enhanced features fail?
     *   **Gemini's Answer:**
        *   **Missing/Corrupted Data:** For missing sections, return `null` or an empty array for the section content, rather than throwing an error, unless the section is strictly required for the term's validity. For corrupted data, log the error, and consider returning a partial response with a warning, or a default/placeholder value, depending on the severity and impact.
        *   **Fallback Strategy:** If enhanced features fail (e.g., a complex AI-generated section cannot be rendered), the system should ideally **gracefully degrade** to providing the basic term information. This means the core term data should still be accessible even if the enhanced sections are unavailable.

### **Implementation Decisions:**

5. **Migration Strategy:**
   - One route at a time or batch migration by functionality?
   - Should we maintain backward compatibility during migration?
     *   **Gemini's Answer:** **One route at a time or very small, tightly related batches, with thorough testing after each.** This minimizes risk. For API compatibility, aim to **maintain backward compatibility** for existing clients during the migration by ensuring `enhancedStorage` can serve the same basic data structure as `optimizedStorage` by default. New enhanced features will be opt-in.

6. **Testing Approach:**
   - What level of test coverage is needed before going to production?
   - Should we implement feature flags for gradual rollout?
     *   **Gemini's Answer:** Aim for **high scenario coverage** for critical paths and **80%+ line coverage** for `enhancedStorage.ts` and core routes. **Yes, consider feature flags** for gradual rollout of the new `enhancedStorage` integration, especially for high-traffic routes. This allows for A/B testing and quick rollback.

7. **API Design:**
   - How should clients request enhanced data? Query parameters? Headers? Different endpoints?
   - Should we version the API to distinguish enhanced vs basic responses?
     *   **Gemini's Answer:** Use **query parameters** (e.g., `?includeSections=true`) for opt-in enhanced data. This is the simplest and most flexible for controlling data granularity. API versioning (e.g., `/v2/terms`) should be reserved for significant, breaking changes to the API contract, not just for optional data inclusion.

### **Long-term Strategy:**

8. **S3 Pipeline Integration:**
   - How should the enhanced storage layer integrate with the future S3 pipeline?
   - What changes to enhancedStorage would be needed for S3 support?
     *   **Gemini's Answer:** The `enhancedStorage` layer would primarily interact with the database, which would be populated by the S3 ingestion pipeline. Changes to `enhancedStorage` would be minimal, focusing on:
        *   Ensuring its methods can efficiently query the database schema that results from the S3 ingestion.
        *   Potentially adding methods to trigger re-ingestion from S3 (e.g., for content updates) or to directly access S3 for very large, infrequently accessed content blobs (though the database should be the primary source for structured data).

9. **Content Governance:**
   - How should the storage layer support content versioning and review workflows?
   - What hooks or events should we implement for content change tracking?
     *   **Gemini's Answer:** The storage layer (`enhancedStorage`) can support content governance by:
        *   **Version Tracking:** Storing version identifiers for terms/sections in the database, potentially linking to S3 object versions.
        *   **Audit Fields:** Including `createdAt`, `updatedAt`, `createdBy`, `updatedBy` fields in relevant tables.
        *   **Status Fields:** Adding `status` fields (e.g., `draft`, `pending_review`, `published`) to content tables.
        *   **Hooks/Events:** Implement database triggers or application-level events (e.g., "TermUpdated", "SectionReviewed") that can be consumed by a separate content governance service or logging system. This decouples content changes from the review workflow.
