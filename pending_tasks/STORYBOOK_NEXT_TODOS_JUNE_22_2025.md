# Storybook Next Steps & TODOs (as of June 22, 2025)

## Scope Clarification & Plan

You've asked for a list of next actionable TODOs based on the recent Storybook setup, migration, and visual testing improvements. I'll focus on concrete, high-leverage next steps that logically follow from the current state, and that would further strengthen your visual testing, documentation, and component quality. I'll also flag any assumptions or open questions.

This document outlines the next actionable TODOs and recommendations following the successful setup, migration, and stabilization of Storybook for visual testing in the AIMLGlossary/AIGlossaryPro project.

## Next TODOs After Storybook Setup & Migration

### 1. Expand Story Coverage
- [ ] **Write Stories for All Key Components**
  - Ensure every reusable UI component (especially in `client/src/components/` and `client/src/components/sections/`) has at least one Storybook story.
  - Prioritize complex, interactive, or business-critical components (e.g., `EnhancedTermCard`, `SectionContentRenderer`, `AIAdminDashboard`).
- [ ] **Add Edge Case & State Stories**
  - For each component, add stories for loading, error, empty, and edge-case states.
  - Include stories for mobile/responsive layouts using Storybook’s built-in viewports.

### 2. Visual Regression Testing
- [ ] **Integrate Visual Regression Testing**
  - Set up a tool like Chromatic or Storybook’s built-in test runner for automated visual regression checks.
  - Document the workflow for running and reviewing visual diffs.

### 3. Accessibility (a11y) Audits
- [ ] **Enable Storybook Accessibility Addon**
  - Ensure the a11y panel is enabled and used to audit components for accessibility issues.
  - Add accessibility acceptance criteria to component stories.

### 4. Documentation & Developer Experience
- [ ] **Enrich Storybook Docs**
  - Use Storybook’s MDX/DocsPage to add usage examples, prop tables, and design guidelines for each component.
  - Link to relevant design files or Figma specs if available.
- [ ] **Update CONTRIBUTING.md**
  - Add a section on how to write, run, and maintain stories.
  - Document the visual testing workflow and troubleshooting steps.

### 5. CI/CD Integration
- [ ] **Add Storybook Build to CI Pipeline**
  - Ensure Storybook builds (and optionally deploys as a static site) on every PR/merge.
  - Optionally, set up Chromatic or Netlify/Vercel preview deployments for visual review.

### 6. Test Coverage & Quality
- [ ] **Audit and Increase Test Coverage**
  - Review which components lack unit/visual tests and add as needed.
  - Ensure all stories are covered by at least basic snapshot or interaction tests.

### 7. Refactor/Optimize Stories
- [ ] **Deduplicate and Refactor Stories**
  - Remove redundant stories, consolidate similar ones, and ensure stories are DRY and easy to maintain.

### 8. Ongoing Maintenance
- [ ] **Regularly Update Storybook & Addons**
  - Monitor for new Storybook releases and migration guides.
  - Schedule periodic reviews to keep stories and documentation up to date.

---

## Assumptions & Open Questions
- **Assumption:** All deprecated addon issues are resolved and Storybook is stable.
- **Assumption:** No major refactors are planned for the component structure in the near term.
- **Open Question:** Is there a design system or Figma file to align stories with?
- **Open Question:** Should visual regression be enforced as a blocking check in CI, or just as a review tool?

---

## Relevant Files to Update
- `client/src/components/**/*.tsx` (stories for each component)
- `.storybook/` (config, preview, addons)
- `docs/STORYBOOK_GUIDE.md` (expand with new workflows)
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` (add Storybook/testing section)
- CI config files (e.g., `.github/workflows/`, if integrating Storybook build/test)

---

**Summary:**  
The next TODOs are to expand story coverage, add visual regression and accessibility checks, enrich documentation, integrate with CI/CD, and ensure ongoing maintenance. This will maximize the value of your new Storybook setup and ensure robust, production-grade UI quality.

Let me know if you want to prioritize or clarify any of these, or if you want a ready-to-use task list in Markdown for your project!

## New Areas Assessment

### Analytics and Dashboards
- [ ] **Complete Analytics Dashboard Implementation**
  - Fix Chart.js integration issues and typing errors in AnalyticsDashboard.tsx
  - Test analytics queries with full dataset for performance optimization
  - Verify data accuracy (e.g., term views, user engagement metrics)
  - Add filtering controls (timeframe, content type, granularity)
  
- [ ] **Secure Analytics Endpoints**
  - Add admin verification to all analytics routes (currently some are public)
  - Implement admin auth check on export endpoint as noted in TODO
  - Review and restrict analytics access to prevent unauthorized data queries
  
- [ ] **Optimize Analytics Performance**
  - Test queries with large datasets ("top 20 terms by views", "monthly active users")
  - Ensure proper use of existing indexes for date, user_id fields
  - Add time range filters and pagination where needed

### Role-Based Access Control (Auth & Permissions)
- [ ] **Strengthen RBAC Implementation**
  - Document admin management process (SQL snippets, procedures)
  - Review all new routes for proper authorization requirements
  - Create admin management UI for role assignments (future enhancement)
  
- [ ] **Audit Current Permissions**
  - Verify all sensitive endpoints require appropriate roles
  - Test admin-only features to ensure proper access control
  - Document permission matrix for different user roles
  
- [ ] **Plan Future Role Expansion**
  - Design Moderator/Editor roles for community contributions
  - Plan Premium User roles for monetization features
  - Consider RBAC library adoption for complex permission management

### Internationalization and Localization
- [ ] **Assess i18n Requirements**
  - Evaluate target markets and language priorities
  - Research user base demographics and language preferences
  - Define scope: UI-only vs. full content translation
  
- [ ] **Prepare i18n Infrastructure**
  - Integrate react-i18next library for UI text management
  - Externalize hardcoded strings into language JSON files
  - Plan content translation strategy (AI-assisted vs. human)
  
- [ ] **Consider Localization Beyond Language**
  - Plan date/time formatting for different locales
  - Research search tokenization for non-Latin scripts
  - Design locale detection and switching mechanisms

### Monetization Strategies
- [ ] **Analyze Current Usage Patterns**
  - Use analytics to identify most valuable/costly features
  - Determine which features could be premium (semantic search, AI features)
  - Calculate cost per user and break-even points
  
- [ ] **Design Monetization Models**
  - Plan tiered subscription structure (free vs. premium)
  - Evaluate enterprise/education licensing opportunities
  - Consider API monetization for external integrations
  
- [ ] **Implement Monetization Infrastructure**
  - Integrate payment processing (Stripe, etc.)
  - Add subscription management to user accounts
  - Implement feature gating based on user plan
  - Design billing and subscription management UI
  
- [ ] **Plan Revenue Optimization**

  - Monitor conversion rates and user retention
  - Develop customer support processes for paying users

### Implementation Priority Assessment
**High Priority (Next Sprint):**
- Complete Analytics Dashboard (revenue insights)
- Secure Analytics Endpoints (security)
- Strengthen RBAC Documentation (maintenance)

**Medium Priority (Next Quarter):**
- Plan Monetization Models (business growth)
- Audit Current Permissions (security)
- Assess i18n Requirements (market expansion)

**Low Priority (Future Consideration):**
- Full i18n Implementation (market dependent)
- Advanced Role Expansion (growth dependent)
- Enterprise Features (demand dependent)
