## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Critical Issues (Immediate)
- Fix keyboard navigation for 3D visualization
- Add ARIA labels and roles to interactive elements
- Ensure all form fields have proper labels
- Implement focus management for modal dialogs

### Phase 2: High Priority Issues (1-2 weeks)
- Improve color contrast ratios
- Add text alternatives for complex visualizations
- Enhance focus indicators
- Implement error handling and announcements

### Phase 3: Enhancement (2-4 weeks)
- Add skip navigation links
- Implement high contrast mode
- Add keyboard shortcuts
- Enhance mobile accessibility

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Automated Testing**
   - Integrate axe-core for continuous accessibility testing
   - Use Lighthouse accessibility audits in CI/CD
   - Add accessibility linting to development workflow

2. **Manual Testing**
   - Keyboard-only navigation testing
   - Screen reader testing (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver)
   - Color blindness simulation testing
   - Mobile accessibility testing

3. **User Testing**
   - Test with users who have disabilities
   - Gather feedback on accessibility improvements
   - Conduct regular accessibility reviews
